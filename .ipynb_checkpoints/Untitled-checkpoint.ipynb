This is the product and the VALUE that you have been searching for. This is the product that you will buy again & again!\\n\\nWe have been in the business (science) of developing non-cannabis, personal choice sensitive smoking agendas for a good, goodly while. Along this avenue of ethnobotany, we have always strived to achieve greater and greater \"Sensitivity / Responsiveness\" & Aphrodisia within our gourmet smokables and brews. And indeed, we have. Many of these previous products are still marketed today by companies who are less developmental than our botanical resource cooperative. Even our own two signature \"smokables\" (Ragga Dagga & Stoney Mahoney) are being discontinued. That Shangrila Zowie Wowie is by far such a superior product is undeniable, therefore it makes no sense to us at all to offer any other smoking product. Quite simply we have surpassed even our own expectations of excellence, thereby; our definition of excellence has evolved. This \"Shangrila\" project has been in research and development for sometime on two fronts. First, on an agricultural level, fields for our Gnarly SweetGrass!\\n must be planted and be allowed to propagate for several years before initial harvest can even be undertaken. This is how the botanical achieves \"potent significance\" much like the regimen of ginseng. Also, harvest time is limited and can take place only twice a year, as like the hemp plant, maximum potency is only achieved after \"flowering\" occurs. But, unlike the hemp plant, and for that matter, unlike most herbs, the entire base plant of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (leave, stem & root) is all \"viripotent,\" which makes this \"gnarly stoke\" a botanical phenomenon! As well, most potentiating factors of Shangrila, as well as the primary botanical factor of Shangrila, will not achieve \"viripotency\" if grown in our hemisphere, therefore; Shangrila is indeed a multi-national, multi-complicated, agricultural undertaking. However, all of this undertaking has indeed been worthwhile! Secondly, the potentiating, infusion regimen used to enhance the attributes of Shangrila has also taken a lon!\\ng time to bring into potent fruition as there are many balancings of the various molecular factors involved in the completion of Zowie Wowie. We are most pleased to be able to say, as you will note in the experience of Shangrila Zowie Wowie, that this process has achieved fruition.\\n\\nSuffice to say, without any hype or glype, Shangrila Zowie Wowie Gnarly SweetGrass is without a doubt, the most significant, non-invasive, non-cannabis, \"sensitive/responsive\", personal choice, absolutely legal (cannot fail a drug test), smoking (\"Smoka\") botanical on our planet ... probably in the universe! Hard to believe that this product is ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!\\n\\n* Mill-stoned & honed.\\n* Depressive regressive!\\n* Psychologically uplifting!\\n* Good-bye stress, anxiety & restlessness!\\n* Sophisticated, well-balanced \"ambiance.\"\\n* Inspires contemplativeness and creativity.\\n* \"Potentiated\" & viripotent!\\n* 4 \\x96 5 draws lasts a good, goodly while.\\n* Sweet aphrodisia! (Horny Goat Weed factoring)\\n* Simultaneously; uplifting and relaxing!\\n* Easy ignition, Smooth draw, Sweet, heady taste.\\n* Easy on, easy off!\\n* SATISFACTION GUARANTEED!\\n* No \"munchie\" factor.\\n* No failed drug tests!\\n\\nShangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) Gnarly \"SweetGrass\" botanical is best utilized as a viri-potent \"Smoka\", via an herb-pipe. As is an herbalist\\'s way, four or five draws of \"Smoka\" should be inhaled and retained. For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage this herbaceousness as a potentiated tea/brew. (Steep approximately one teaspoon of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.) When smoking Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm), please draw gently as it is a most preeminent \"Sensitive / Responsive\" Smoke. Both a personal water-pipe (huuka) (water-pipe is included with quarter pound can only) and a standard herb-pipe are included for your smoking convenience and delight. Smoke and Brew concurrently is absolutely a Sweet, Sensitive Treat!\\n\\nShangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) \"Sensitive/Responsive\" Smoka includes and is potentiated with the following non-irradiated, Mill-Stoned & Honed, exotica botanicals and botanical essences: Half-edged Lily-rare Bian Lian (lobeline factors), Kona Lactuca virosa, Yucatan Turnera aphrodisaca, Hawaiian Vervain (Maui strain), Siberian Leonorus Sibricus, rare Lotus Leaf, Jamaican Blue Verbena officinalis, Spanish Peumus Crocus Sativa, Chinese (flowering-tops only) Horny Goat Weed, Ginko Biloba, African Cola Vera, and African Wilde Dagga (flowering-tops only). Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) does not include any tobacco or any cannabis factors. Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) does indeed achieve gourmet distinction upon its own merit.\\n\\nShangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) is not intended for use during work or while driving.

Prosaka botanical tablets were originally introduced as a botanical, supplemental alternative to various traditional medications that are prescribed for stress, anxiety, depressiveness, mood enhancement, insomnia, excessive dream activity, etc. We like to use this analogy: Imagine the circumstances of your life to be hurricane-ish. Certainly, Prosaka will not stop the wind from blowing. However, it will help to center you within the calm eye of your hurricane, so that you will better see your living and make your decisions from a calmer, more serene, more balanced perspective. Please note that when undertaking any supplemental herbal regimen in this arena, it is important to make a personal commitment to the therapy. It would make no sense to purchase Prosaka and to take it only sporadic!\\nally or only briefly. It is for this reason, although Prosaka is a very expensive formulation to produce; that we offer 300 count containers at as much of a reduced price as we are able to offer.\\n\\nProsaka is an exclusive, proprietary amalgamation in tablet form which includes the following uncommon botanicals, extracts, flower-top essences and essential oils: Radix Salviae, Sensitive Mimosa Bark, Arillus Euphoriae, Shizandra, Frutcus Mori, Caulis Polygoni, Zizyohus, Tang Kuei, Cedar Seed, Sweetflag Rhizome, Cuscutae, Amber, Radix Scutellariae, Evodia, Longan, Arisaema, Cistanches, Radix Polygalae, Red Sage Root and Eucommia.

Very few applications need the aio_* calls ---\\nessentially only high-performance RDBMS servers even benefit from them\\nat all, and most of those have been faking it fine for a while with\\nmultiple threads or processes.

By\\ncontrast, the Microsoft Windows mechanisms to do similar things (such\\nas completion ports) do not deliver a notification until the process\\npolls them.\\n\\nI don\\'t think signals are a better way to do things in this case\\n(although I haven\\'t written any RDBMSes myself), but you got the\\ntechnical descriptions of the two operating systems exactly backwards.\\nMost programs that use Linux real-time signals for asynchronous\\nnetwork I/O, in fact, block the signal in question and poll the signal\\nqueue in a very Windowsish way, using sigtimedwait() or sigwaitinfo().\\n\\n-- \\n<kragen@pobox.com>       Kragen Sitaker     <http://www.pobox.com/~kragen/>\\nEdsger Wybe Dijkstra died in August of 2002.

Unlike competing solutions that \\n> process XML data in software, DataPower\\'s device processes \\n> the data in \\n> hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater \\n> performance, \\n> according to company officials.\\n> \\n> The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the \\n> first in a \\n> family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based \\n> startup. The \\n> DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology \\n> called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML \\n> data.\\n> \\n> According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was \\n> conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future \\n> proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data \\n> between two \\n> businesses.\\n> \\n> \"Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,\" Kelly said. \\n> \"The XA35 is the first of a family.\"\\n> \\n> Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the \\n> file size up \\n> to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on \\n> application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best \\n> alternative.\\n> \\n> In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount \\n> importance in the world of XML.\\n> \\n> \"Today\\'s firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,\" Kelly \\n> said. \"A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. \\n> Firewalls are blind to XML today.\"\\n> \\n> Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on \\n> security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.\\n> \\n> According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML \\n> processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach \\n> the company \\n> itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with \\n> regards to speed \\n> and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to \\n> creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.\\n> \\n> \"Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,\" said Kelly, \\n> adding that to his knowledge no other company\\'s solution does. Kelly \\n> said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with \\n> technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that \\n> he believes \\n> will be mostly false.\\n> Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) \\n> accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes \\n> of a packet, \\n> while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at \\n> 1,400 bytes \\n> and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.\\n> \\n> The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large \\n> collection of \\n> XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the \\n> markup language \\n> as they pass through the device.\\n> \\n> The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load \\n> balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and \\n> will identify \\n> and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.\\n> \\n> In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an \\n> application \\n> co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators \\n> more granular \\n> control over what data is inspected and the application server itself \\n> controls the device.\\n> \\n> DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging \\n> market. Startup \\n> Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega \\n> XPE switch in \\n> May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, \\n> launched with a \\n> focus on content processing and acceleration.\\n> The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at \\n> $54,995. The \\n> company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in \\n> field trails at a number of other enterprises.\\n> \\n> ==============================================================\\n> ===========\\n> \\n> DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs \\n> since it was \\n> founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who \\n> foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols \\n> would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry \\n> interest in XML \\n> grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and \\n> designed the industry\\'s first solutions to address the unique \\n> requirements for processing XML.

IN REVIEW</b><br>\\nThe Entire Tech Week in a Single Email<br>\\nSaturday, July 20, 2002<p>\\n<p>\\n<b>Mac fans flocked to the Macworld Expo in New York to watch Apple Compute=\\nr trot out new hardware, software and even a Web services plan--but it migh=\\nt be a challenge getting people to pay for the offerings.\\n</b>\\n<p>\\nApple CEO Steve Jobs kicked off the trade show by <a href=3D\"http://clickth=\\nru.online.com/Click?q=3D14-5MRAIF-I438XVu98ZvQIzTKtR1dR\" >unveiling</a> new=\\n iPod digital-audio players and a new flat-panel iMac.\\n<p>\\nThe new iPod players include models built specifically for computers that u=\\nse Microsoft\\'s Windows operating system. Apple lowered the price of the exi=\\nsting 5GB iPod and a redesigned 10GB model, which is thinner and comes with=\\n a new case and remote control. Jobs also introduced a beefier 20GB iPod fo=\\nr $499. The iPod stable now includes three models for Mac users and three m=\\nodels for Windows users with MusicMatch software.\\n<p>\\nAs expected, Jobs introduced a new iMac model with a 17-inch flat-panel mon=\\nitor. The model offers a widescreen display with 1,440-by-900-pixel resolut=\\nion versus 1,024-by-768-pixel resolution for the 15-inch iMac.\\n<p>\\nJobs also previewed the next version of Mac OS X, version 10.2, which will =\\nbe on store shelves Aug. 24 for $129. OS X 10.2 includes a new Finder with =\\nimproved search features, spring-loaded folders and the ability to change t=\\nhe background photo as often as every 5 seconds.\\n<p>\\nBut fans who rushed to OS X last year learned there\\'s no such thing as a ch=\\neap upgrade when the company announced it will <a href=3D\"http://clickthru.=\\nonline.com/Click?q=3D29-Sg_rIjM3xjSzf59NyGEI9rCM8vcR\" >not offer</a> a disc=\\nounted upgrade version of Mac OS X version 10.2, code-named Jaguar, to curr=\\nent users of the operating system. To get Jaguar, current OS X users will h=\\nave to buy a new Macintosh or an entirely new version of the operating syst=\\nem for the retail price of $129.\\n<p>\\nApple\\'s decision not to sell a less-expensive upgrade version lay in the qu=\\nalitative difference between version 10.1 and 10.2. Although the versions s=\\nhare the same core technology, Jaguar includes several new features and ser=\\nvices, such as search tool Sherlock 3 and Internet address finder Rendezvou=\\ns, which arguably classify it as an entirely new piece of software.\\n<p>\\nApple also raised eyebrows by <a href=3D\"http://clickthru.online.com/Click?=\\nq=3D3e-F51nIizcfoh9HOq_7DQESNPe-iRR\" >transitioning</a> its iTools Web serv=\\nices from a free program to a paid program called .Mac. The company plans t=\\no charge about $100 per year for the program. The collection of Web service=\\ns was launched about three years ago, and now includes online storage via a=\\n service called iDisk, online greeting cards through iCards and other featu=\\nres.\\n<p>\\nDespite iTool\\'s popularity, the company <a href=3D\"http://clickthru.online.=\\ncom/Click?q=3D53-n86dINniBiqIX-sjHpx8lOheMnlR\" >may face a tough sell</a> w=\\nith the .Mac program. The history of paid services, is not a pretty picture=\\n. Customers have bristled when companies try to slap charges on previously =\\nfree services. Some have succeeded but many have struggled, especially when=\\n free alternatives lurked elsewhere. In the early 1990s, Apple\\'s efforts to=\\n form online communities and popularize search engines failed magnificently=\\n.\\n<p>\\nTo its advantage, Apple has presented a fairly coherent and tangible set of=\\n services with .Mac. And although its software division is far more organiz=\\ned than it once was, it\\'s unclear how overwhelming demand will be. However,=\\n an <a href=3D\"http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=3D68-iM8qIsPWu8FuzAvywvj=\\nsK-FdLP4R\" >online petition</a> protesting the new charges doesn\\'t bode wel=\\nl for the program.\\n<p>\\n<b><font color=3D\"#CC0000\">Microsoft\\'s moves</font></b><br>\\nNot one to be caught in anyone\\'s shadow, Microsoft plans to <a href=3D\"http=\\n://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=3D7d-FFEqIDLWMEqg-q9Uywq2NRJSBTeR\" >offer a=\\n rebate</a> for its Office suite for Mac OS X to those who buy the software=\\n bundle when they pick up a new Mac. The promotion entails a $50 mail-in re=\\nbate for people buying a new Mac and upgrading to Office v. X, and $100 for=\\n those buying a Mac and the full version of the software.\\n<p>\\nThe offers come after Microsoft revealed that sales of the software have no=\\nt met its expectations. The software potentate had expected to sell 750,000=\\n copies of Office v. X by now, but instead has sold only 300,000 since the =\\nprogram went on sale last November.\\n<p>\\nMicrosoft is also putting the <a href=3D\"http://clickthru.online.com/Click?=\\nq=3D93-V4PmQSdrF0o9nH2cTYjvQ8Rgn5FR\" >finishing touches</a> on the third co=\\nllection of Windows 2000 bug fixes, which is nearly ready for release after=\\n a protracted period of testing. The update, Windows 2000 Service Pack 3, c=\\nontains vital security updates and hundreds of fixes to bugs plaguing the o=\\nperating system that Microsoft released in February 2000. Service Pack 3 co=\\nuld be important for many businesses, as not all of the included security f=\\nixes are available as separate downloads.\\n<p>\\n\\nNot everything will be available as a download, however. Weeks before Micro=\\nsoft plans to reinstate Java in Windows XP, it has <a href=3D\"http://clickt=\\nhru.online.com/Click?q=3Da8-02XZQQZDjZijEBtDtZs6swzdON9R\" >shut down</a> a =\\nsite that would automatically send its Java software to Windows XP users. T=\\nhe company closed the install-on-demand feature 30 days after it told Java =\\ninventor Sun Microsystems it would reinstate Java in Windows XP through the=\\n forthcoming Service Pack 1 but remove it altogether in 2004.\\n<p>\\n<b><font color=3D\"#CC0000\">Somebody\\'s watching you</font></b><br>\\n\\nYou better watch what you write in Yahoo\\'s free e-mail service--because Yah=\\noo is. To protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated filter=\\n to <a href=3D\"http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=3Dbd-c0nUQ7pV9moRKw2pAEV=\\ngnfqGsJuR\" >swap out</a> a handful of words such as \"mocha\" and \"eval\" that=\\n pertain to Web code known as JavaScript.\\n<p>\\nThe reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as \"Web enhanced\" can contai=\\nn JavaScript instructions able to run programs on the recipient\\'s PC. JavaS=\\ncript is a Web language that can issue commands such as telling the browser=\\n to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change a password, for =\\nexample.\\n<p>\\n\"Mocha\" is one of those special commands that can be run from Web-enhanced =\\ne-mail. Typing \"mocha:\" into the location bar of the Netscape browser will =\\nopen a screen with a display area and a text box underneath, in which comma=\\nnds can be entered. A malicious hacker could, for example, use the command =\\nline to run a program that changes a person\\'s password without that person\\'=\\ns knowledge.\\n<p>\\n\\nOn the heels of plans for new powers to patrol people\\'s Web use, the U.S. g=\\novernment is again turning to technology to <a href=3D\"http://clickthru.onl=\\nine.com/Click?q=3Dd2-THo_QULs_DzX3rh3Gl22vbAOyesR\" >monitor suspicious acti=\\nvity</a> in the name of fighting terrorism. The government has unveiled mor=\\ne details of its Terrorist Information and Prevention System (TIPS), a plan=\\n to recruit volunteers across the country who will keep tabs on dubious or =\\nsuspicious behavior.\\n<p>\\n\"The program will involve the millions of American workers who, in the dail=\\ny course of their work, are in a unique position to see potentially unusual=\\n or suspicious activity in public places,\" according to the TIPS Web site. =\\nBut the American Civil Liberties Union, one of several critics of the plan,=\\n fears the proposal will encourage racial profiling and vigilantism, possib=\\nly leading to searches of private homes without a warrant.\\n<p>\\n<b><font color=3D\"#CC0000\">Also of note</font></b><br>\\nA handful of entrepreneurial technology companies are <a href=3D\"http://cli=\\nckthru.online.com/Click?q=3De7-2y-GQmVce3pzCGTVqS8CMB0qvsZR\" >advancing tec=\\nhniques</a> once used haphazardly by record companies and Napster-haters, i=\\nn ways that may be far more destructive to the credibility of file-swapping=\\n networks than were previous efforts...Apple <a href=3D\"http://clickthru.on=\\nline.com/Click?q=3Dfc-WpHmQVwTaudE4Aca9-0t3VVat9dR\" >released</a> the final=\\n version of its QuickTime 6 digital media software, marking a stand-down in=\\n a dispute over licensing fees...The Federal Trade Commission is <a href=3D=\\n\"http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=3D11-l8riI2-aPLcop-3X3VynhNBuCqcR\" >pl=\\nanning</a> to take a deeper look at whether some state laws illegally restr=\\nict Internet commerce...In one of the toughest sentences for online auction=\\n fraud, a Virginia man was <a href=3D\"http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=\\n=3D26-KqPVIiMxelrEsJeBBBkqU8niQ7RR\" >sentenced</a> to 12 years in prison fo=\\nr defrauding hundreds of shoppers on eBay and Yahoo auction sites...The Hou=\\nse of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a bill that would allow for <=\\na href=3D\"http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=3D3c-tK4RIcIw_GtL-2JY0VXXjhrH=\\nNHdR\" >life prison sentences</a> for malicious computer hackers...MPEG LA, =\\na group of patent holders governing MPEG-4, <a href=3D\"http://clickthru.onl=\\nine.com/Click?q=3D51-QgUWIjJWhghTxK5Jlh9GpMUHM3rR\" >finalized licensing ter=\\nms</a> for the media delivery standard, bowing to market pressure for manag=\\neable royalty rates...Several tech and telecommunications giants are <a hre=\\nf=3D\"http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=3D66-kDH_IyWzTRfhSOLsPj9y-DzbW-iR\"=\\n >considering a joint venture</a> to pepper the United States with wireless=\\n \"hot spots.\"\\n<p>\\n<i>Want more?

This\\nis necessitated by my urgent need to reach a \\ndependable and trust worthy foreign partner. This request may seem strange\\nand unsolicited but I crave your indulgence \\nand pray that you view it seriously. My name is COL. MICHAEL BUNDU of the\\nDemocratic Republic of Congo and one of \\nthe close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of\\nCongo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may \\nhis soul rest in peace. \\n\\nDue to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in\\nmy country, I and some of my colleagues were \\ninstructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and\\nammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five Hundred \\nThousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel\\ngroup. We were then given this money privately \\nby the then President, LAURENT KABILA, without the knowledge of other\\nCabinet Members. But when President Kabila \\nwas killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his bodyguards a day before we\\nwere schedule to travel out of Congo, We \\nimmediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here\\nin Congo for safe keeping. The security of the \\nsaid amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and\\nseizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava \\n(One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military\\nPersonnel from our same tribe, by the new \\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President\\nLaurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. \\n\\nIn view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who\\ncan assist us to move this money out of my country \\nas the beneficiary. \\nWE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' here to move the fund under Diplomatic\\nCover to a security company in Europe in your \\nname. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked\\n''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it \\nwill not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. \\n\\nOur inability to move this money out of Congo all this while stems from\\nour lack of trust of our supposed good friends \\n(western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked\\nwith the late President Kabila, immediately \\nafter his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other,\\nthe information We gathered from an associate \\nwho has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with\\nyour sincere assistance, this transaction will \\nbe properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two\\nweeks. The said money is a state fund and \\ntherefore requires a total confidentiality. \\n\\nWe would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this\\nfund in Europe. This is because we are under \\nrestricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in\\norder not to lose this fund which we have worked \\nso hard for. Thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out\\nof Congo, you can contact me through my email \\naddresses, Tel/Fax nos. above with your telephone, fax number and personal\\ninformation to enable us discuss the \\nmodalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.\\n\\nPlease note that There are no RISKS involved in this Deal as everyone's\\nSecurity is Guaranteed if we follow the required \\nguidelines. I will hence furnish you with further details of this Deal as\\nsoon as I am assured of your Sincere interest to assist \\nus. \\n\\nI must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the\\nutmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily \\nconfidential, Whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response.\\nThank you and God Bless. \\nBest Regards \\n\\n\\nCOL.

People have tried\\nto put their friends\\'/relatives\\' names on all five\\nthinking they could get all the money. But it does\\nnot work this way. Believe us, some have tried to\\nbe greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not\\ntry to change anything other than what is instructed.\\nBecause if you do, it will not work for you.\\nRemember, honesty reaps the reward!!! \\n\\nThis IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a\\nproduct for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it\\nas such and you will be VERY profitable in a short\\nperiod of time.\\n\\n1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this\\nadvertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the\\nperson in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through\\nthe cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.\\n\\n2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.\\n\\n3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.\\n\\n4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.\\n\\n5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2\\n\\n6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.\\n\\nPLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address\\nACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.\\n\\n==================================================\\n**** Take this entire letter, with the modified\\nlist of names, and save it on your computer.\\nDO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.\\n\\nSave this on a disk as well just in case you lose\\nany data. To assist you with marketing your business\\non the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will\\nprovide you with invaluable marketing information\\nwhich includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,\\nwhere to find thousands of free classified ads and\\nmuch more. There are 2 primary methods to get this\\nventure going:\\n\\nMETHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY\\n==================================================\\n\\nLet\\'s say that you decide to start small, just to see\\nhow it goes, and we will assume you and those involved\\nsend out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let\\'s also assume\\nthat the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)\\nresponse (the response could be much better but let\\'s\\njust say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send\\nout hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only\\n5,000 each.\\n\\nContinuing with this example, you send out only\\n5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only\\n10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded\\nby sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of\\n50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%\\nresponded with orders. That\\'s 100 people who\\nresponded and ordered Report # 2.\\n\\nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for\\na total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to\\nthat is 1000 orders for Report # 3.\\n\\nThose 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a\\ntotal of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%\\nresponse is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.\\n\\nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each\\nfor a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.\\nThe 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for\\nReport # 5.\\n\\nTHAT\\'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00\\n(half a million dollars).\\n\\nYour total income in this example is: 1..... $50\\n+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000\\n+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00\\n\\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND\\nFIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO\\nMATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL\\nMAKE A LOT OF MONEY!\\n==================================================\\n\\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE\\nORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think\\nfor a moment what would happen if everyone or half\\nor even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000\\ne-mails each or more?\\n\\nThere are over 150 million people on the internet\\nworldwide and counting, with thousands more coming\\nonline every day. Believe me, many people will do\\njust that, and more!\\n\\nMETHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\\n==================================================\\n\\nAdvertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and\\nthere are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.\\nPlacing a lot of free ads on the internet will\\neasily get a larger response. We strongly suggest\\nyou start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you\\ngo along. For every $5 you receive, all you must\\ndo is e-mail them the report they ordered. That\\'s it.\\nAlways provide same day service on all orders.\\n\\nThis will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,\\nwith your name and address on it, will be prompt\\nbecause they cannot advertise until they receive\\nthe report.\\n\\n===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================\\nThe reason for the \"cash\" is not because this is\\nillegal or somehow \"wrong\". It is simply about time.\\nTime for checks or credit cards to be cleared or\\napproved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one\\ncan SEE there is money in the envelope and steal\\nit before it gets to you.\\n\\nORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.\\nNotes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for\\neach report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the\\ncash is concealed by wrapping it in at least\\n2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of\\npaper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report\\nyou are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your\\nname and postal address.\\n\\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW :\\n==================================================\\n \\nREPORT # 1: \"The Insider\\'s Guide To Advertising\\nfor Free On The Net\"\\n\\nOrder Report #: 1 from\\nRui Sousa Santos\\nP.O. Box 132\\nTaylors Lakes VIC  3038\\nAustralia\\n ______________________________________________________\\n\\nREPORT # 2: \"The Insider\\'s Guide To Sending Bulk\\nEmail On The Net\"\\n\\nOrder Report # 2 from: \\nRichard Moulton\\nP.O.

Lee\\nP.O. Box 19\\n52 Victoria Drive\\nLondon SW19 6BD\\nUnited Kingdom\\n______________________________________________________\\n$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$\\n\\nFollow these guidelines to guarantee your success:\\n\\n=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for\\nReport #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails\\nuntil you do.\\n\\n=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks\\nafter that you should receive 100 orders or more for\\nREPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or\\nsending e-mails until you do.\\n\\n** Once you have received 100 or more orders for\\nReport # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is\\nalready working for you, and the cash will continue\\nto roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time\\nyour name is moved down on the list, you are placed\\nin front of a different report.\\n\\nYou can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which\\nreport people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO\\nGENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS\\nAND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT\\nto the income you can generate from this business !!!\\n=================================================\\nFOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: \\nYou have just received information that can give you\\nfinancial freedom for the rest of your life, with\\nNO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can\\nmake more money in the next few weeks and months\\nthan you have ever imagined. Follow the program\\nEXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way.\\nIt works exceedingly well as it is now.\\n\\nRemember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report\\nafter you have put your name and address in\\nReport #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as\\ninstructed above. One of the people you send this\\nto may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your\\nname will be on every one of them. \\n\\nRemember though, the more you send out the more\\npotential customers you will reach. So my friend,\\nI have given you the ideas, information, materials\\nand opportunity to become financially independent.\\n\\nIT IS UP TO YOU NOW !\\n\\n=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============\\n\"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in\\nChicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.\\nCorporation and I make pretty good money. When I\\nreceived this program I grumbled to Jody about\\nreceiving \\'junk mail\\'. I made fun of the whole\\nthing, spouting my knowledge of the population\\nand percentages involved. I \\'knew\\' it wouldn\\'t work.\\nJody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and\\nfew days later she jumped in with both feet. I made\\nmerciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old\\n\\'I told you so\\' on her when the thing didn\\'t work. \\n\\nWell, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had\\nreceived 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she\\nhad received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!\\nI was shocked. I have joined Jody in her \\'hobby\\'.\"\\n\\nMitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois\\n================================================\\n\"Not being the gambling type, it took me several\\nweeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.\\nBut conservative as I am, I decided that the initial\\ninvestment was so little that there was just no way\\nthat I wouldn\\'t get enough orders to at least get\\nmy money back. I was surprised when I found my\\nmedium size post office box crammed with orders.\\nI made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. \\n\\nThe nice thing about this deal is that it does not\\nmatter where people live. There simply isn\\'t a\\nbetter investment with a faster return and so big.\"\\n\\nDan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada\\n=================================================\\n\"I had received this program before. I deleted it,\\nbut later I wondered if I should have given it a try.\\nOf course, I had no idea who to contact to get\\nanother copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed\\nagain by someone else......... 11 months passed then\\nit luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!\\nI made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the\\nmoney came within 22 weeks.\"\\n\\nSusan De Suza, New York, N.Y.\\n=================================================\\n\"It really is a great opportunity to make relatively\\neasy money with little cost to you. I followed the\\nsimple instructions carefully and within 10 days the\\nmoney started to come in. My first month I made $20,\\nin the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the\\nthird month my total cash count was $362,840.00.\\nLife is beautiful, Thanx to internet.\"\\n\\nFred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand\\n=================================================\\n\\nORDER YOUR REPORTS TODAY AND GET STARTED ON YOUR\\nROAD TO FINANCIAL FREEDOM !\\n\\n=================================================\\nIf you have any questions of the legality of this\\nprogram, contact the Office of Associate Director\\nfor Marketing Practices, Federal Trade Commission,\\nBureau of Consumer Protection, Washington, D.C.\\n\\nThis message is sent in compliance of the proposed\\nbill SECTION 301, paragraph (a)(2)(C) of S. 1618. \\n\\n* This message is not intended for residents in the\\nState of Washington, Virginia or California,\\nscreening of addresses has been done to the best\\nof our technical ability.\\n\\n*  This is a one time mailing and this list will\\nnever be used again.\\n\\nslaxflhxbkltlrolpefciayxx\\n\\n\\n'},\n",

I've been\\nusing MH or nmh since 1985 and exmh since 1995.  17 years is a long\\ntime!\\n\\n\\n\\n_______________________________________________\\nExmh-users mailing list\\nExmh-users@redhat.com\\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users\\n\\n\\n\"},\n",

Recently, in private email, \\nErnest Miller claimed that doing so would be a violation of the DMCA. In this \\nin-depth special report, I show that using perfectly legal, (I assume) \\nlicensed, off-the-shelf consumer software, copying DVDs is easy and in many \\nways encouraged. \\n\\n*Tools:*\\n1 PowerBook G4 with slot-loading DVD drive (any model should work)\\n1 Monsters, Inc. Collector\\'s Edition DVD (any DVD should work)\\n1 copy of Mac OS X 10.2 \"Jaguar\" \\n\\n*Process:*\\n1. Insert DVD into drive. Notice how Jaguar helpfully loads the DVD Player for \\nyou.\\n2. Open the DVD (it appears on the desktop) and drag the VIDEO_TS folder to \\nyour hard drive. Ejct the DVD.\\n3. In DVD Player, select \"Open VIDEO_TS Folder...\" from the File menu. Use the \\ndialog that appears to select the VIDEO_TS folder on your hard drive. \\n\\nNow the DVD plays just like it would were the DVD in the drive. By extension, I \\ncould also put the DVD up on my site for you to download and watch. I could \\nshare it via a P2P network. And I haven\\'t done anything to decrypt the DVD or \\nviolate the DMCA: I\\'ve used only basic tools available to all normal computer \\nusers on my (I assume) fully-licensed consumer laptop. \\n\\n*Disclaimer:* Seth Schoen, whose opinion I highly respect on these matters, \\nfinds it unlikely that the DVD was CSS-encrypted if this was possible. I am not \\nsure how to verify if the DVD is CSS-encrypted. If someone has a suggestion, \\nplease let me know. However, if it is true, then it\\'s very interesting that \\nDisney has released such a major movie without encryption.\\n\\n\\n\\n'},\n",

You see it over and over again in\\nhistory:  The Primitive People pull a fast one on Whitey The Junior\\nAnthropologist, playing to all the prejudices of Whitey (who only became\\nJunior Anthropologists to support personal ideologies), and before you\\nknow it the charade takes on a life of its own which the Primitive\\nPeople are compelled to perpetuate.  Worse, even when there is\\nsubstantial evidence to the contrary with some basic scholarship, the\\nfacts have a hard time competing with the ideologically pleasing fiction\\nthat is already firmly entrenched.  And many peoples (e.g. American\\nIndians) develop a profit motive for maintaining and promoting the myth\\nin popular culture.\\n\\nI\\'m far more inclined to believe that people is people, no matter where\\nyou are on the planet.  The only time you see any anomalies is when you\\nhave a self-selecting sub-population within an otherwise normal\\npopulation, which is hardly a fair way to look at any major population.\\n\\n-James Rogers\\n jamesr@best.com\\n\\n\\n\\n'},\n",

A configuration is sequence of directives, each\\ndirective consists of zero or more tokens, and each token can be either a\\nstring or again a complete sequence. This means the configuration syntax\\nhas a recursive structure and allows you to create configurations with\\narbitrarily-nested sections. The configuration syntax also provides\\ncomplex single/double/balanced quoting of tokens,\\nhexadecimal/octal/decimal character encodings, character escaping, C/C++\\nand shell-style comments, etc. The library API allows importing of a\\nconfiguration text into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), traversing the AST,\\nand optionally exporting the AST again as a configuration text.  \\n\\nLicense: MIT/X Consortium License\\n\\nURL: http://freshmeat.net/projects/cfg/\\n\\n                        - %  - %  - % - % -\\n\\n[060] - OSSP fsl 0.1.12 \\n  by Ralf S.

It is based on the model of arbitrary number of\\nchannels, stacked together in a top-down data flow tree structure with\\nfiltering channels in internal nodes and output channels on the leave\\nnodes. Channel trees can be either constructed manually through\\nlower-level API functions or all at once with a single API function\\ncontrolled by a compact syntactical description of the channel tree. For\\ngenerating log messages, a printf-style formatting engine is provided\\nwhich can be extended through callback functions. The data flow inside the\\nchannel tree is controlled by logging message severity levels which are\\nassigned to each individual channel.  \\n\\nLicense: MIT/X Consortium License\\n\\nURL: http://freshmeat.net/projects/l2/\\n\\n                        - %  - %  - % - % -\\n\\n[062] - Papercut NNTP Server 0.8.3 \\n  by Jo\\xe3o Prado Maia (http://freshmeat.net/users/jcpm/)\\n  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 00:34\\n\\nCommunications :: Usenet News\\nSoftware Development :: Libraries :: Python Modules\\n\\nAbout: Papercut is a multi-threaded NNTP server written in Python. Its\\nmain objective is to integrate existing Web-based message board software\\n(Phorum on the first few versions) with a Usenet front-end. However, its\\nextensibility enables developers to write their own container for the\\nstorage of the Usenet articles (messages). That means that the code is\\nextensible enough that you could write new containers to integrate the\\nnews server with other Web message board projects or even other ways to\\nstore the messages. \\n\\nChanges: The various storage modules have been redesigned, and initial\\ncode for NTTP authentication was added. New features include a standalone\\nMySQL storage module with no Web front-end, an authentication module for\\nPhorum, and the concept of a \\'read-only\\' / \\'read-write\\' server with\\npassword protection.

It is designed from the\\nbeginning for multilingual use, even for writing bi-directional texts\\n(e.g. mixed English and Hebrew). The design focuses on comfortable and\\nfast typing of well-formed XML documents. Thus XMLtype is not meant to\\ncompete with advanced console editors like Emacs or VIM. For full\\nfunctionality, XMLtype requires UTF-8 console support. It is being\\ndeveloped under Linux and for the ANSI/VT-100 terminal. \\n\\nChanges: This release fixes an ugly I/O bug caused by previous bugfixing. \\n\\nLicense: GNU General Public License (GPL)\\n\\nURL: http://freshmeat.net/projects/xmltype/\\n\\n                        - %  - %  - % - % -\\n\\n[106] - Zina 0.9.1 \\n  by Ryan (http://freshmeat.net/users/pancake/)\\n  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 06:00\\n\\nInternet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content\\nMultimedia :: Sound/Audio :: Players :: MP3\\n\\nAbout: Zina is a graphical interface to your MP3 collection,  a personal\\njukebox, and an MP3 streamer.

You can squeeze several times the performance out of\\na C server program than a Java one simply by being able to finely tune\\n(or more frequently, bypass) the system resource management. \\nNonetheless, this is not a significant factor for most applications you\\ncould conceivably develop in either language, as most aren\\'t limited by\\nraw performance scalability.\\n\\n\\n-James Rogers\\n jamesr@best.com\\n\\n\\n'},\n",

This bundled collection of search plug-ins makes it \\npossible to look for almost anything using Sherlock. Their Web site \\nwon\\'t wow you, but SearchStandard\\'s free plugins most certainly make \\nfinding things online, including searches on your favorite Mac sites, \\nthat much easier.\\n\\n\\n\\n<!-- GnomeNETWORK -->\\n<p><br><table bgcolor=\"#FFCC99\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tr><td><p class=\"title\">&nbsp;GnomeNETWORK</p></td></tr></table><p>\\n<b>Xnet v1.0.6 [216k] OSX $48</b><p>\\n\\n<a class=\"url\" href=\"http://bitcom.ch/products-xnet-e.html\">http://bitcom.ch/products-xnet-e.html</a><p>\\n\\nDealing with servers that offer mission critical services, like \\nintranet access, e-mail, or Web serving, means dealing with those \\nservices failing from time to time. Don\\'t be left in the dark \\nwhen one of your services go down, let Xnet keep you informed. \\nThe unregistered version of the product lets you verify http, \\nping, smtp, and ftp service availability, with many more service \\nverifications included in the pro version. Xnet runs on your \\nlocal machine, verifying remote service availability and sending \\nyou a message when those services go down. The interface allows \\nfor user-defined services, with alert features for both an e-mail \\naccount (mine alerts are going to my cell phone) and locally via \\na sound from your machine.\\n\\n\\n\\n<!--  GnomeTERMINAL -->\\n<p><br><table bgcolor=\"#FFCC99\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tr><td><p class=\"title\">&nbsp;GnomeTERMINAL</p></td></tr></table><p>\\n\\nFor OS X installs with multiple users, there may come a time when you \\nneed to change ownership of a particular file. This is particularly \\nuseful in situations where one user created a file, but an entirely \\ndifferent user is the only one who will ever make future decisions \\nrelating to that file, like whether to keep it or throw it in the \\nTrash. chown is the Terminal command designed to handle this. From \\nthe command line type:\\n<p>\\nsudo chown username filename\\n<p>\\nYou\\'ll of course want to substitute the username of the new owner for \\nusername.

Best, \\nRohit\\n\\n===========================================================\\n\\nDataPower delivers XML acceleration device\\nBy\\xa0Scott Tyler Shafer\\nAugust 27, 2002 5:46 am PT\\n\\nDATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed \\nspecifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that \\nprocess XML data in software, DataPower\\'s device processes the data in \\nhardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, \\naccording to company officials.\\n\\nThe new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a \\nfamily of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The \\nDataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology \\ncalled XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML \\ndata.\\n\\nAccording to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was \\nconceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future \\nproliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two \\nbusinesses.\\n\\n\"Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,\" Kelly said. \\n\"The XA35 is the first of a family.\"\\n\\nKelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up \\nto 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on \\napplication servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best \\nalternative.\\n\\nIn addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount \\nimportance in the world of XML.\\n\\n\"Today\\'s firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,\" Kelly \\nsaid. \"A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. \\nFirewalls are blind to XML today.\"\\n\\nFuture products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on \\nsecurity, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.\\n\\nAccording to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML \\nprocessing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company \\nitself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed \\nand security. After trying the software path, the company turned to \\ncreating a solution that would process XML in hardware.\\n\\n\"Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,\" said Kelly, \\nadding that to his knowledge no other company\\'s solution does. Kelly \\nsaid in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with \\ntechnologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes \\nwill be mostly false.\\nOther content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) \\naccelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet, \\nwhile the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes \\nand thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.\\n\\nThe 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of \\nXML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language \\nas they pass through the device.\\n\\nThe XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load \\nbalancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify \\nand process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.\\n\\nIn addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application \\nco-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular \\ncontrol over what data is inspected and the application server itself \\ncontrols the device.\\n\\nDataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup \\nSarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in \\nMay, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a \\nfocus on content processing and acceleration.\\nThe DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The \\ncompany has announced one customer to date and says the product is in \\nfield trails at a number of other enterprises.\\n\\n=========================================================================\\n\\nDataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was \\nfounded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who \\nforesaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols \\nwould have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML \\ngrew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and \\ndesigned the industry\\'s first solutions to address the unique \\nrequirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software \\ninterpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing \\nis still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.\\n\\nLeveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from \\ndeveloping software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov\\'s team raised the bar \\nand designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In \\n2001, DataPower\\'s effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3\\x99), the \\nindustry\\'s fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.\\n\\nToday, XG3\\x99 technology powers the industry\\'s first wire-speed XML \\nnetwork devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web \\nServices. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of \\nproducts, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, \\nproviding an immediate return on technology investments to \\nindustry-leading customers and partners.\\n\\nDataPower\\'s M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that \\nbrings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries, \\ndrawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including \\nAkamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.\\n\\n=========================================================================\\n\\nDataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in Funding\\n\\nVenrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneer \\nin XML-Aware Networking for Web Services\\n\\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the \\nleading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced \\nthat it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing. Investors for \\nthis round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed \\nCapital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, of Mobius, \\nand Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPower\\x92s Board of \\nDirectors.\\n\\nDataPower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and \\nsales of the company\\x92s breakthrough technology for XML-Aware networking. \\nFounded in 1999, DataPower invented the world\\x92s first intelligent XML \\nnetworking\\xa0devices, capable of transforming XML traffic and transactions \\nat the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services \\nand other XML-centric initiatives. DataPower\\x92s solutions are based on \\nits patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3\\x99) technology.\\n\\n\"Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and \\nintra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill \\nprepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. \\nDataPower\\x92s XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of \\nXML that is required to support next generation enterprise \\napplications,\" said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower \\nTechnology.\\n\\n\"DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML that\\x92s critical to Web \\nservices projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance.\" A single \\nDataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 \\nservers\\x97breaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML \\nprocessing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In \\naddition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, \\nprotection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of \\ne-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing \\nbetween back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.\\n\\n\"In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require \\nlaser-focused scrutiny. DataPower\\x92s patent-pending technology addresses \\na very real and growing pain point for enterprises,\" said Michael \\nTyrrell of Venrock Associates. \"By turbo-charging their networks with \\nDataPower\\x92s unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be \\nfree to adopt next generation Web services without encountering \\nperformance and security pitfalls.\"\\n\\n\"We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly \\ngrowing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and \\nsecurity,\" said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. \"DataPower is on \\ntheir third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML \\nGeneration Three (XG3)\\xa0technology was quite simply the single most \\ncompelling technology solution we have seen to date.\"\\n\\n\"XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious \\nabout optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been \\ndeveloping solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web \\nservices,\" said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. \"DataPower\\x92s \\nXML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely \\non XML for mission critical applications.\"\\n\\nAbout Venrock Associates\\nVenrock Associates was founded as the venture capital arm of the \\nRockefeller Family and continues a tradition of funding entrepreneurs \\nthat now spans over seven decades.

We can subpoena the records of\\nthe ISP that provided them service, and of the credit card they used for\\nthe whack-a-mole accounts.  We can use private investigators.  Yes,\\nthese people are often lowlifes (chickenboners).  But, they\\'re not\\nsecret agents.  They\\'re just trying to make a buck, and Habeas\\' whole\\nbusiness is about finding them and putting them out of business\\n\\nHabeas has the incentive to pursue spammers (that use our warrant mark)\\nin a way that no one ever has had before.  Given that our whole business\\nplan relies on Habeas becoming synonymous with \"not spam\", I can\\'t\\nunderstand why you would assume ahead of time that we will be\\nunsuccessful, plan for that failure, and in so doing, remove the\\npotential of success, which is anti-spam filters like SA acting on the\\nHabeas warrant mark.\\n\\nDaniel, it\\'s easy enough for you to change the Habeas scores yourself on\\nyour installation.  If Habeas fails to live up to its promise to only\\nlicense the warrant mark to non-spammers and to place all violators on\\nthe HIL, then I have no doubt that Justin and Craig will quickly remove\\nus from the next release.  But, you\\'re trying to kill Habeas before it\\nhas a chance to show any promise.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, SpamAssassin is like the Club, in that it\\nencourages thieves (spammers) to just go after the next car (those\\nwithout SA) rather than yours.  Habeas can play the role of LoJack (the\\ntransmitter), in enabling the apprehension of thieves so that they don\\'t\\nsteal any more cars.  But only if we\\'re given a chance to succeed.\\n\\n          - dan\\n--\\nDan Kohn <mailto:dan@dankohn.com>\\n<http://www.dankohn.com/>  <tel:+1-650-327-2600> \\n\\n-----Original Message-----\\nFrom: Daniel Quinlan [mailto:quinlan@pathname.com] \\nSent: Wednesday, August 28, 2002 16:38\\nTo: Matthew Cline\\nCc: spamassassin-talk@example.sourceforge.net\\nSubject: Re: [SAtalk] O.T.

Between now and conclusion of the first court\\n   case, we could have years of spam in our mail boxes!\\n\\n - Contact information can change: phone numbers, PO boxes, stolen\\n   cell phones, temporary email addresses, etc.\\n\\n - Spammers do not always remember to include contact information!  I\\n   don\\'t understand it either, but nobody said they were bright.  Also,\\n   some spam is non-commercial or sent by a third-party (for example,\\n   \"pump and dump\" stock scams), so contact information is not strictly\\n   required for the spammer to get their way.\\n\\nDan\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: Jabber - The world\\'s fastest growing \\nreal-time communications platform!

At the time, we felt that the advertising industry created a huge opportunity for the company\\'s direct sourcing technology solutions, and so far the company has delivered. Although the company has raised just $2 million in the two years it has been developing its\\x92 technology, it has increased revenues sources dramatically by opening a financial services division expanding the Live Media Marketplace expected revenues to $3-5 mm during fiscal 2003, driving the line in 2004 to $15- 25 mm. This remarkable growth becomes more understandable when one views the savings that its direct sourcing model generates for advertisers and retailers. The company saves advertising buyers up to 70% in costs dramatically increasing wholesale pricing effect, by saving time & efforts, cutting telephone and faxing bills, while providing free mass sourcing opportunities for negotiating advertising buying and selling opportunities using a secure state of the art real time negotiating technology over the Internet, we\\x92ve never seen anything like it!\\n\\nHow does the company do this? \\n\\nXrayMedia (OTCBB: XRMD) The Company founded XrayMedia in March 2000 to create a \"mass source to advertising sector \" live negotiating technology and advertising purchase financing accents the company\\x92s\\x92 strengths, serving both large and small United States and International customers with advertising opportunities delivered directly from the media and the general public. *** With the use of proprietary software, it is providing sophistication to this industry which greatly expedites orders and finds opportunities based on the users\\x92 criteria which results in a savings to the advertising buyers and as well as the ad sellers which it serves. \\n\\nTheir \"source to business model\", eliminates two levels of hindrance (sourcing and limited opportunities) and provides its customers with mass advertising choices and live negotiating that is designed give a substantially low cost base for finding the right advertising opportunity for all business with no cost.\\n\\nWhile investors have thrown money recklessly at money-losing technology companies, here is a company that will increase revenues from $1 to $25 million in three years, and grow profitability substantially with little funding. XrayMedia is among the best performing sectors since September 11th, and we feel that XrayMedia is likely to break through its 52-week high of $00.19 soon.\\n\\n *** Listed on the OTCBB and trading with an extremely low market valuation under 10 mm.\\n\\n*** It has opened accounts with over hundreds of buyers and sellers including some of the largest media buyers in the world, major retailers and smaller retailers. \\n\\n*** Attracting interest of major investment bankers and analysts, also a possible acquisition target at some point by major retailers.\\n\\n*** Received largest order of advertising financing over $500k with more contracts accumulating.\\n\\n*** Revenue growth is expected to be dramatic $1mm to $5mm. \\n\\n*** The company is expected to report a profitable quarter, to grow revenues and earnings \"substantially\" when it begins its 2003 fiscal year in January.\\n \\nShares Outstanding:      \\t83 mm\\nFloat:                         \\t5  mm\\nRecent Price:               \\t$00.08\\nYear Low/High:            \\t$00.02 - $00.19\\n18-Month Target Price:  \\t$5.00+\\n\\nCompany Contact: Ray Dabney \\nToll free:  1(888) 777-0658     \\n\\n(h3)6926Zjpl7\\n\\n\\n'},\n",

If\\nyou send an HTML message to someone who has a yahoo.com account,\\nsomething may get lost in the translation. Try sending this\\nsentence: \"My medieval mocha has an expression to evaluate.\"\\nAgain, be sure this note is sent in HTML format. The results will\\nsurprise you. As far as I can tell, they\\'re doing this to stop any\\nscripts from being distributed to their user base. I must credit\\nMarion Schroll for making me aware of the \"problem.\" It\\'s kinda\\nfunny, in a weird sort of way. Not that I would want anything I\\nsend changed in any way, shape, or form. It begs the question:\\nwhat next? I mean, where does it all stop? Give them a bit, and\\nthey just might take a byte. Censorship is only a stone\\'s throw\\naway.\\n\\n<p>\\n\\nI really feel for Lockergnomie Sharon Clark, who asks: \"What is\\nthis crazy business with the broadband metering? What they\\nadvertise doesn\\'t seem to be what you get. Now that I\\'m forking\\nout $60 per month for a supposed metered rate of 640 down / 320\\nup, I\\'m feeling clueless and left out in the cold.

I\\'m feeling lied to; why can\\'t I download \\'til my 40 gig\\nis full? That is what they promised me and that is what I THOUGHT\\nI was paying for. I want consistent speed - is this too much to\\nask?\" It\\'s not too much to ask the question, but it\\'s probably too\\nmuch to get the answer.

The people who were saying that it\\ndid not happen did not see the fadeout in progress. It only came back\\nafter the server was rebooted properly. However improbable it seemed at\\nthe time, the nameservers came back up after a power outage without the\\n.ie zonefile. As a result it, there was nothing in the file that the\\nsecondaries picked up. At the time, I thought that the file was on an\\nNFS. But if it regenerated after reboot, and the NFS input was not\\nthere, it would have generated a blank zonefile - that makes some sense.\\nHistory now but it has an alarming relevance. :)\\n \\n> As an aside, shortly after my note on Friday uucp-gw-1.pa.dec.com and\\n> uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com stopped responding to DNS requests. So IE had\\n> two dead nameservers, four stuck a week in the past and three\\n> working correctly. Marvellous.\\n\\nConfirm that. The nameservers themselves had connectivity problems from\\nwhat I could see and it was going on for a while, even *after* the\\ninitial SOA problems. \\n\\nI am thinking of writing a simple .ie secondary state monitor for\\ninclusion on WhoisIreland.com as these guys seem to be technologically\\nincapable of running their own DNSes. What kind of distorted logic hands\\nthe admin of a national tld to a company that does not even handle DNS\\nfor its own domain? Whatever selection process IEDR used should be\\ninvestigated by the relevant government department, especially as the\\ncompany supposedly providing technical administration to IEDR did not\\nactually spot this loss of synch. The IEDR contract with the company\\nshould be reviewed in the light of this event. This kind of 1 week loss\\nof synch should not happen with a national domain.

This is an easy(tm) \\njob if the code uses assignment, if(), for() and functions, but not if \\nit uses GOTO.

Zoey\\'s mom thought she knew everything about her perfect teenage daughter. But when she realizes that her child is addicted to drugs, both of their worlds spin out of control. This dramatic film delves into the topic of teenage drug addiction and features stellar performers Mia Farrow, Andrew McCarthy and Julia Whelan, from TV\\'s \"Once and Again.\" Go behind the scenes with the cast [ http://www.lifetimetv.com/movies/originals/bio1.html ],\\nread real-life recovery stories of teen drug addicts [ http://www.lifetimetv.com/reallife/health/features/teen_addiction.html ], and learn how to keep your kids drug-free with 10 expert tips [ http://www.lifetimetv.com/reallife/health/features/drug_free.html ].\\n\\n*************************************************************************\\n\\nTHE BUZZ ABOUT THE UPCOMING MOVIE\\n\\nPeople are already talking about the sensitive subject of kids and drug addiction featured in \"The Secret Life of Zoey.\"\\nLifetimetv.com community member BELFAST BELLE writes:\\n\"My belief is that I started using drugs to fit in and to cope with things that happened to me. My mom died when I was 10. I had to live away from my dad and brothers. Where I grew up I was sexually abused for years, but I didn\\'t dare tell anyone. When I finally went to live with my dad and brothers, I had no self-esteem left. I experienced so much shame, and in my mind it seemed as if everyone knew what happened. Drugs helped me to feel OK and like I was a part of something. When my dad died, I was devastated. It threw me into a full-blown addiction. My drug use landed me in rehab, in debt and in strained relationships with my brothers. Thanks to the help of Narcotics Anonymous, I have been clean since December 28, 1991. I now have great relationships with my siblings. I love them more than they will ever know. I also have a beautiful seven-year-old daughter who has never seen her mother touch drugs. I don\\'t have any desire to use, either -- just the desire to be the best pe\\n rson I can be.\"\\n\\nExpress yourself!

This makes sense, for two reasons. First, most people \\nwho pay for software have new computers. So while OS X may only have a small \\nfraction of the installed base, it has the majority of the population of people \\nwho are opening their wallets. Second, if OS X isn\\'t successful, the Mac is _\\nover_. It\\'s not like System 9 is getting any more popular. \\n\\nThen again, there are very few conditions under which it is actually the right \\nbusiness decision to develop software for the Macintosh. Developing for the Mac \\nis not a whole lot different than creating a web site _that only works on \\nNetscape_. (Given the market share of Macs[2] (about 3.5%) and the market share \\nof Netscape[3] (about 3.4%), that is not a silly comparison.) \\n\\nRobb Beal wrote[4]: \"Try this test. Go to a venture firm, angel, or big company \\nwith a Mac OS X product/concept/prototype. Do they consider the fact that it\\'s \\na Mac application a net plus? (No.)\" Well _duh_. Your product would have to \\nappeal to _25 times more Mac _users_ _[as a percentage] than Windows users just \\nto break even. In other words, if your Windows product appeals to 1 in 100 \\nWindows users, you have to appeal to 25 in 100 Mac users to make the same \\namount of money. \\n\\nNow, you may want to make an _emotional_ appeal to developing for the Mac. \\nThat\\'s fine. If you like Macs and you\\'re doing it for fun, more power to ya. \\n\\nBut as long as we\\'re talking _investment_, you have to tell me why you\\'re going \\nto get 25 times as many users. Maybe there\\'s less competition in your category \\non the Mac; maybe you\\'re in a niche like graphics where it seems like Macs \\ndominate (they don\\'t, it just seems that way because the elite graphics people \\nin big American cities use Macs); maybe your product can\\'t sell to mixed \\nenvironments unless it runs everywhere. But if you want to make an investment \\nin Mac software be prepared to demonstrate how you\\'re going to overcome that \\nmagic 25 multiplier.\\n\\n[1] http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/2002/09/10\\n[2] http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/0207/03.marketshare.php\\n[3] http://websidestory.com/cgi-bin/wss.cgi?corporate&news&press_1_193\\n[4] http://radio.weblogs.com/0001123/2002/04/10.html\\n\\n\\n'},\n",

Hettinga\\nSunday, August 25, 2002\\n\\n(BOSTON) When you think about it one way, the FBI/Winter Hill vs.\\nPatriarcha/Angiulo Cosa Nostra fight was just another race war\\nbetween thugs.\\n\\nPut crudely, and at its most racist, the FBI and the Winter Hill Gang\\nwere the (mostly) Irish thugs, and Patriarcha\\'s \"family\" were, of\\ncourse, the (mostly) Italian thugs.\\n\\n\\nThink Scorsese\\'s upcoming \"Gangs of New York\", only with\\ncounter-reformatory overtones. Hoover\\'s South Boston \"social-club\"\\nputsch, starting in the mid 1960\\'s, was particularly audacious in\\nhindsight. The U.S. Federal Government actually decided to underwrite\\na reversal of the prohibition-era capture of the nation\\'s rackets by\\nthe Italians from the Irish. The fact that the plot was hatched not\\nfor New York, but for South Boston, the most Irish place in the US,\\nonly makes even more gigantic the Big Lie that was told by the FBI to\\nits ostensible political masters about bringing down organized crime\\nthere once and for all.\\n\\nThe result, as we all found out, wasn\\'t swapping the heroin of\\nItalian Boston mob violence for Irish methadone. Hoover was,\\nposthumously, swapping it for Oxycontin, or crystal methamphetamine\\n- -- or, more properly, PCP. The absolute psychopathology of violence\\nin Whitey Bulger\\'s crack-cocaine-era reign of Boston\\'s drug markets,\\nlike the identical FBI-sponsored reigns or violent horror by other\\nalso-rans in cities across the US as a whole, went up whole orders of\\nmagnitude, not mere percentage points.\\n\\nAs Stalin said once, quantity has a quality all it\\'s own. And, make\\nno mistake, J. Edgar Hoover was directly responsible that \"quality\"\\nof carnage, nation-wide.\\n\\n\\nSo, yes, on paper at least, it really *was* just the swapping of one\\ngang of racist thugs for another, and the result was, on paper, at\\nleast, business as usual. Same stuff, different century, with\\napparently decent people like Mr. Salvati et.al accidently ground on\\nthe gears of \"justice\" like so much hamburger.\\n\\nHowever, to be much more macabre about it, that hamburger was\\n\"greasing\", if you will, an auto de fe only a homicidal lunatic could\\nlove: a perfectly functioning market, legislated out of existence --\\non paper, if nowhere else -- by government fiat and the, back-door,\\nbut still elitist, will to power of H.L. Mencken\\'s famous \"bluenoses\\nand busybodies\".\\n\\n\\nIt all starts, like all true evil does, from the most innocent of\\nbeginnings. What she couldn\\'t do to alcohol, teatotaling Mrs. Grundy\\nthen tried to do to anything else she could think of that had a\\nsmaller, \"manageable\" demand. The bloody result was, like nine more\\nheads of the hydra, an increasingly ubiquitous universal prohibition,\\nin more markets, and for more things, as the 20th century wore on.\\n\\nEvery time some recreational drug was found to be addictive, or\\nharmful, or physically distasteful, or carcinogenic -- or, now,\\napparently, fattening -- and then prohibited, exactly the same thing\\nhappened to its markets that happened to alcohol during the Volstead\\nyears. A *larger* market than before the prohibition. Hugely\\nlucrative profits for anyone with the moral stomach to violently\\nscale newly-legislated \"barriers to competition\" imposed on them by\\nthe state. Increasingly violent attacks by the government on users of\\nthose substances. And, finally, the ultimate in evil -- the kind of\\nevil this country actually fought wars to end -- increasingly\\ncoercive axe-handle beatings, by our own government, of the sacred\\nliberty of the average, but now unavoidably-law-breaking, citizenry.\\n\\nAs Ayn Rand cynically observed a long time ago, you don\\'t need\\ngovernment if nobody\\'s breaking the law. In some twisted corollary to\\nParkinson\\'s Law, governments, to survive, *need* more people,\\nbreaking more laws, or they can never justify the money they\\nconfiscate at tax time.\\n\\nAnd, to bring us back to the point, David Friedman would probably\\necho here his father Milton\\'s famous observation that government\\nregulations only benefit the regulated sellers in a given market, and\\nnever the consumer, much less the economy as a whole. Even,\\n*especially*, if those sellers are *breaking* the law, as they are in\\nthe increasingly ubiquitous prohibition of risky behavior that our\\ngovernment now imposes on us.\\n\\n\\nAnd there, absent the apparent grace of Mr. Hoover, went Mr. Salvati.\\n\\nIn fact, Hayek himself, in \"The Road to Serfdom\", couldn\\'t have\\npredicted any better the gory consequences of Hoover\\'s blatant\\nimposition, \"for our own good\", of Vietnam-era statist power at the\\nneighborhood level. And, furthermore, *Stalin* couldn\\'t have had\\nbetter \"useful idiots\" than Hoover did -- and neither, by an\\nabsolutely literal extension, did Whitey Bulger after Hoover.\\n\\nUseful idiots on both sides of the congressional aisle. Idiots who\\nwere eating out of Hoover\\'s power-craven hand for the entire middle\\nof the 20th century -- and Whitey Bulger\\'s hand, whether they knew it\\nor not, until the end of the millennium. A time, you\\'ll notice, which\\nsaw the increasingly steady imposition of \"mob\" violence, and market\\ncontrol, from both state and illegal interests, way beyond the\\nimaginings of even the most power-mad, rum-running, stock-kiting,\\nmovie-flopping, bureau-pumping, Nazi-appeasing Irish-Bostonian Little\\nCaesar. Or, as for that matter, his safely trust-funded, and now\\nstrictly political, descendents.\\n\\nIn terms of actual financial economics, think of what happened to Mr.\\nSalvati and the others, dead or alive, as a \"transfer-price\", in\\nhuman lives, of the inevitable consequence of MacNamara-style\\nVietnam-era Keynesian \"social-cost\" input-output accounting at its\\nmost despicable, and you can almost begin to fathom the atrocity that\\nwas committed by Hoover, and his co-religionists in state economic\\ncontrol, in the name of what really was, as you\\'ll now agree, just a\\nrace war between thugs up in Boston.\\n\\n\\nThis shouldn\\'t be a surprise, really. All race wars are at least\\nfought by thugs, though they\\'re usually conceived elsewhere, and\\nendorsed, at the time, by all the \"right\" people, for all the \"right\"\\nreasons.\\n\\nAs far as the FBI itself goes, remember Mancur Olson\\'s observation\\nthat a \"prince\" is just a stationary bandit.\\n\\nThough, given his penchant for women\\'s clothing, for other men, and,\\nwhat\\'s actually obscene, for violently hypocritical treatment of\\npeople of his own affectional preference, I suppose we can call J.\\nEdgar Hoover a bandit \"princess\", instead.\\n\\n\"Bandit Queen\", of course, would be a grievous insult to queens --\\nand real bandits -- everywhere.\\n\\nCheers,\\nRAH\\n- ---------\\n\\n\\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/25/national/25FBI.html?todaysheadlines=\\n&pagewanted=print&position=top\\n\\n\\nThe New York Times\\nAugust 25, 2002\\nHoover\\'s F.B.I. and the Mafia: Case of Bad Bedfellows Grows By FOX\\nBUTTERFIELD\\n\\nBOSTON, Aug. 24 - It was March 1965, in the early days of J. Edgar\\nHoover\\'s war against the Mafia. F.B.I. agents, say Congressional\\ninvestigators, eavesdropped on a conversation in the headquarters of\\nNew England\\'s organized-crime boss, Raymond Patriarca.\\n\\nTwo gangsters, Joseph Barboza and Vincent Flemmi, wanted Mr.\\nPatriarca\\'s permission to kill a small-time hoodlum, Edward Deegan,\\n\"as they were having a problem with him,\" according to an F.B.I. log\\nof the conversation. \"Patriarca ultimately furnished this O.K.,\" the\\nF.B.I. reported, and three days later Mr. Deegan turned up dead in an\\nalley, shot six times.\\n\\nIt was an extraordinary situation: The Federal Bureau of\\nInvestigation had evidence ahead of time that two well-known\\ngangsters were planning a murder and that the head of the New England\\nMafia was involved.\\n\\nBut when indictments in the case were handed down in 1967, the real\\nkillers - who also happened to be informers for the F.B.I. - were\\nleft alone. Four other men were tried, convicted and sentenced to\\ndeath or life in prison for the murder, though they had had nothing\\nto do with it.\\n\\nOne, Joseph Salvati, who spent 30 years in prison, filed notice with\\nthe Justice Department last week that he planned to sue the F.B.I.\\nfor $300 million for false imprisonment.\\n\\nHis is the latest in a series of lawsuits against the F.B.I., the\\nJustice Department and some F.B.I. agents growing out of the tangled,\\ncorrupt collaboration between gangsters and the F.B.I.\\'s Boston\\noffice in its effort to bring down the mob.\\n\\nThe lawsuits are based on evidence uncovered in the last five years\\nin a judicial hearing and a Justice Department inquiry. But some of\\nthe most explosive evidence has only recently come to light,\\nincluding documents detailing conversation in which Mr. Patriarca\\napproved the murder. They were released as part of an investigation\\nby the House Committee on Government Reform, which has pressured the\\ndepartment into turning over records about the F.B.I in Boston.\\n\\nThe documents show that officials at F.B.I. headquarters, apparently\\nincluding Mr. Hoover, knew as long ago as 1965 that Boston agents\\nwere employing killers and gang leaders as informers and were\\nprotecting them from prosecution.\\n\\n\"J. Edgar Hoover crossed over the line and became a criminal\\nhimself,\" said Vincent Garo, Mr. Salvati\\'s lawyer. \"He allowed a\\nwitness to lie to put an innocent man in prison so he could protect\\none of his informants.\"\\n\\nMr. Barboza was a crucial witness at trial against Mr. Salvati and\\nmay have implicated him because Mr. Salvati owed $400 to a loan shark\\nwho worked for Mr. Barboza.\\n\\nAsked about the documents showing that Mr. Hoover knew of Mr.\\nSalvati\\'s innocence when he was put on trial, Gail Marcinkiewicz, a\\nspokeswoman for the F.B.I. in Boston, declined to comment, citing the\\npending litigation.\\n\\nA Justice Department task force is continuing to investigate\\nmisconduct in the Boston office. In one of the first results of the\\ninvestigation, one retired agent, John J. Connolly, is awaiting\\nsentencing next month after being convicted of racketeering and\\nobstruction of justice for helping two other mob leaders who were\\nF.B.I. informers, James Bulger and Stephen Flemmi. Vincent and\\nStephen Flemmi are brothers.\\n\\nThe Government Reform Committee, led by Representative Dan Burton,\\nRepublican of Indiana, has uncovered memorandums from the Boston\\noffice to headquarters in Washington revealing the bureau\\'s knowledge\\nthat Vincent Flemmi and Mr. Barboza were involved in killing Mr.\\nDeegan. A memorandum a week after the killing described the crime,\\nincluding who fired the first shot.\\n\\nThen, on June 4, 1965, Mr. Hoover\\'s office demanded to know what\\nprogress was being made in developing Vincent Flemmi as an informer.\\n\\nIn a reply five days later, the special agent in charge of the Boston\\noffice said that Mr. Flemmi was in a hospital recovering from gunshot\\nwounds but because of his connections to Mr. Patriarca \"potentially\\ncould be an excellent informant.\"\\n\\nThe agent also informed Mr. Hoover that Mr. Flemmi was known to have\\nkilled seven men, \"and, from all indications, he is going to continue\\nto commit murder.\" Nevertheless, the agent said, \"the informant\\'s\\npotential outweighs the risk involved.\"\\n\\nA Congressional investigator called the exchange chilling. \"The most\\nfrightening part is that after being warned about Flemmi\\'s murders,\\nthe director does not even respond,\" the investigator said. \"There is\\nno message not to use a murderer as a government informant.\"\\n\\nThe origin of the corruption scandal was public and political\\npressure on Mr. Hoover to move more forcefully against the growing\\npower of the Mafia, which he had largely ignored. In Boston, F.B.I.\\nagents recruited Mr. Barboza and Mr. Flemmi and developed close ties\\nto a rival criminal organization, the Winter Hill Gang, led by Mr.\\nBulger.\\n\\nBoth sides got what they wanted, according to the investigations and\\nthe trial of Mr. Connolly. The F.B.I. got information that eventually\\nhelped destroy the Patriarca and Angiulo families, which controlled\\norganized crime in New England. Mr. Bulger\\'s gang was able to take\\nover the rackets in Boston, sell drugs and even commit murder while\\nthe F.B.I. looked the other way.\\n\\nOne reason the F.B.I. may not have used its information about Mr.\\nPatriarca\\'s involvement in the Deegan murder, Congressional\\ninvestigators say, is that it came from an illegal listening device\\nin his Providence, R.I., headquarters.

It doesn\\'t look too hard.\\n\\nNot to beat a dead horse, but that\\'s exactly what my spamcan package\\ndid.  For those just tuning in, spamcan is a thingy I wrote before I\\nknew about Tim & co\\'s work on this crazy stuff; you can download it from\\n<http://woozle.org/~neale/src/spamcan/spamcan.html>, but I\\'m not going\\nto work on it anymore.\\n\\nI\\'m currently writing a new one based on classifier (and timtest\\'s\\nbooty-kicking tokenizer).  I\\'ll probably have something soon, like maybe\\nhalf an hour, and no, it\\'s not too hard.  The hard part is storing the\\ndata somewhere.  I don\\'t want to use ZODB, as I\\'d like something a\\nperson can just drop in with a default Python install.  So anydbm is\\nlooking like my best option.\\n\\nI already have a setup like this using Xavier Leroy\\'s SpamOracle, which\\ndoes the same sort of thing.  You call it from procmail, it adds a new\\nheader, and then you can filter on that header.  Really easy.\\n\\nHere\\'s how I envision this working.  Everybody gets four new mailboxes:\\n\\n  train-eggs\\n  train-spam\\n  trained-eggs\\n  trained-spam\\n\\nYou copy all your spam and eggs* into the \"train-\" boxes as you get it.\\nHow frequently you do this would be up to you, but you\\'d get better\\nresults if you did it more often, and you\\'d be wise to always copy over\\nanything which was misclassified.  Then, every night, the spam fairy\\nswoops down and reads through your folders, learning about what sorts of\\nthings you think are eggs and what sorts of things are spam.  After she\\'s\\ndone, she moves your mail into the \"trained-\" folders.\\n\\nThis would work for anybody using IMAP on a Unix box, or folks who read\\ntheir mail right off the server.  I\\'ve spoken with some fellows at work\\nabout Exchange and they seem to beleive that Exchange exports\\nappropriate functionality to implement a spam fairy as well.\\n\\nAdvanced users could stay ahead of the game by reprogramming their mail\\nclient to bind the key \"S\" to \"move to train-spam\" and \"H\" to \"move to\\ntrain-eggs\".  Eventually, if enough people used this sort of thing, it\\'d\\nstart showing up in mail clients.  That\\'s the \"delete as spam\" button\\nPaul Graham was talking about.\\n\\n* The Hormel company might not think well of using the word \"ham\" as the\\n  opposite of \"spam\", and they\\'ve been amazingly cool about the use of\\n  their product name for things thus far.  So I propose we start calling\\n  non-spam something more innocuous (and more Monty Pythonic) such as\\n  \"eggs\".\\n\\nNeale\\n'},\n",

I hear about so many \\npeople being super scared to give out their SS#.  Well folks, \\nI can get your SS# for 50 cents.  Give me a name and address \\nand about 90% of the time I can get the number.  \\n\\nWe are so worried about putting our credit card number on\\nthe net, but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and \\nthey take it out of our sight for 10 minutes.  They could do \\nwho knows what with the CC number.  I once had a person \\ntell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy \\nof her check to anyone (checks by fax) because then that \\nperson (me) would have her account info and could write \\na check out for thousands of dollars.  I told her to just send \\nit to me then and she said that was OK.  Then I asked her \\nto tell me what the difference was between the original check \\nand a fax copy.  I told her to ask her lawyer that too.  Never \\nheard back from her.  \\n\\nThe bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info, it is \\navailable in many places.  Have a good day.\\n--  Terry    http://mysiteinc.com/tfn/lfi.html\\n~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nYes. I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However, \\nwe can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most \\nimportantly, never give any personal information at a site \\nthat is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar \\nor a Veri secure sign or others. \\n\\nAlso, never leave your information stored at a site. I put \\nin my credit information in each time instead of having \\nan account in standing, a little more time but less risks \\ninvolved! Of course, I mostly shop at my own Internet \\nmall and I know how safe it is there, credit card info is \\ndeleted in a matter of seconds. Overall, I believe the web \\nto be a safe and very fruitful new frontier!\\n--  Catherine F.      http://www.catco.nexgenmall.com \\n~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nYes. I had phenomena for 6 weeks and did not realize that \\nmy ISP was shut down at the same time because the owner \\nwas in a bad car accident.  I had a full service account.  \\nMy Internic fees were not paid so my WEB Address \\nwent unprotected.  A Russian stepped in; paid the fees; \\nand, promptly assigned my www.SchoolOfGeomatics.com \\naddress to a porn shop.  Thus, I lost 4 years of building \\nup 1st place rankings on 12 Search Engines and 2nd place \\non 8 more.  This set me back about 4  months: I believe I \\nlost a minimum of $50,000.  \\n \\nI have also been hit with viruses about 10 times.  The first \\ntime I lost almost 4 months of work.  Now, I back up often \\nenough to not to lose so much time.  This is also Internet \\ntheft.  These people are nothing but out and out criminals \\nand should spend years behind bars.\\n \\nCustomers are well protected from credit card theft; \\nhowever, merchants can lose a lot of money.  I sell only by \\npurchase order and certified or registered company checks.\\n--  Peter S.    http://www.GSSGeomatics.com\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n               JULY WINNER ANNOUNCED!\\nAnd the July \\'One-Question Survey\\' WINNER is...\\n\\n           John Stitzel   -   oldstitz@yahoo.com\\n\\n                   Congratulations John!\\n\\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\\n\\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\\nTo change your subscribed address, send both new and old \\naddress to mailto:Submit@AEOpublishing.com \\nSee the link (below) for our Subscription Center to unsubscribe \\nor edit your interests. \\n\\nPlease send suggestions and comments to: \\nmailto:Editor@AEOpublishing.com \\nI invite you to send your real successes and showcase \\nyour strategies and techniques, or yes, even your total bombs, \\n\"Working Together We Can All Prosper.\" \\nmailto:Submit@AEOpublishing.com \\n\\nFor information on how to sponsor Your Membership \\nCommunity & Commentary visit: http://bannersgomlm.com/ezine \\n\\nCopyright 2001 AEOpublishing.com \\n------------------------------------------------\\nweb: http://www.AEOpublishing.com\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis email has been sent to jm@netnoteinc.com at your \\nrequest, by Your Membership Newsletter Services.\\n\\nVisit our Subscription Center to edit your interests or unsubscribe.\\nhttp://ccprod.roving.com/roving/d.jsp?p=oo&id=bd7n7877.8lhtdma6&m=bd7n7877&ea=jm@netnoteinc.com\\n\\nView our privacy policy: http://ccprod.roving.com/roving/CCPrivacyPolicy.jsp\\n\\nPowered by \\nConstant Contact(R)\\nwww.constantcontact.com\\n--1465727098.996838841831.JavaMail.RovAdmin.rovweb003\\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\\n\\n<HTML>\\n<!-- \\n\\n\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTML-FORMATTED MESSAGE BELOW\\n\\nThe remainder of this message is in HTML format for use by email\\nclients that can properly display it.

I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However,\\n<br>we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most\\n<br>importantly, never give any personal information at a site\\n<br>that is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar\\n<br>or a Veri secure sign or others.\\n<p>Also, never leave your information stored at a site. I put\\n<br>in my credit information in each time instead of having\\n<br>an account in standing, a little more time but less risks\\n<br>involved! Of course, I mostly shop at my own Internet\\n<br>mall and I know how safe it is there, credit card info is\\n<br>deleted in a matter of seconds.

It was removed yesterday by members of Kilburn White Horse\\nAssociation, who found a Countryside Alliance badge attached to the carpet.\\nJohn Roberts of the association said: \"It has obviously been very well\\norganised. It was a well crafted piece of kit: a figure of a huntsman with a\\nhorn cut out of carpets.\\n\"It was big and impressive and could be seen for miles about. They tied it\\nto bushes at the top and nailed it down. It caused all the stone chippings\\nto be pushed downwards, which will help turn the white horse grey. It will\\nnot get another refit for another year.\\n\"Whoever did it must have come with a vehicle \\xad a tractor and trailer or a\\nlorry \\xad because the carpet must have come in one piece. It was extremely\\nwell planned and took several people an hour and a half to get it off.\"\\nThe sculpture needs constant work because, unlike chalk horses in the south\\nof England, it is cut into limestone which is the wrong colour and needs\\nwhitening.\\nMr Roberts added: \"The damage as such is not great but it adds to the\\ndeterioration, which means it will need more work next time.\\n\"We would have more sympathy if, having made the point, they would come to\\ntake it away again because it was a major job.\"\\nAndy Wilson, chief executive of the North York Moors National Park, said:\\n\"It is a scheduled ancient monument and the local residents are very proud\\nof it and go to enormous trouble to keep it white. There is also careful\\nconsideration of what shape it should be kept with the constant growth of\\nvegetation so you can understand the alarm and regret at any changes. There\\nhas not been a cut in the turf \\xad which would be much more of a problem. It\\nwould seem it was carefully plotted beforehand.\"\\nAn RCA spokesman said: \"Some people in the country are getting very\\nfrustrated at the inaction. All we want is Ministers to take notice. Marches\\ndon\\'t seem to be doing anything good.\"\\nThe Countryside Alliance said it did not have any part in the action.\\nSpokesman Adrian Yelland said: \"The Countryside Alliance only ever advocates\\ncampaigning that is lawful and dissociates itself from acts of vandalism and\\nregrets any damage that may have been caused by this incident.\"\\nThe incident follows graffiti on road signs and motorway bridges in\\nYorkshire thought to be RCA work.\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

I\\'ve tried the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. I have no \".xsession-errors\" (or \".xession-errors\") in my home \\r\\ndirectory or that of any other user.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. It appears the configuration files for kde4 are found under \\r\\n\"/usr/share/kde4/config\" and also \"/etc/kde4/kdm/\".  I tried moving the \\r\\n\"config\" directory to an obscure location and the doing the \"apt-get \\r\\ninstall --reinstall kdm\".  It regenerated the config directory but no \\r\\nchange in login.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. I found that under /user/bin (when doing the dpkg -L kdm) there is a \\r\\nfile \"genkdmconf\" which looked promising.  Reading the help file for it \\r\\nand executing \"genkdmconf -no-old\", the files under /etc/kde4/kdm were \\r\\nbacked up and new ones regenerated.  Now, I get a different login screen \\r\\nbackground, but the action is still the same -- does not accept my \\r\\npassword.  I can still use the \"console login\" option of that screen and \\r\\nget to the CLI login and doing so still allows me to startx and get \\r\\nthings going.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo it appears that your last paragraph applies.  I\\'ll be glad to try \\r\\n(almost) anything you or anyone else suggests on this.\\r\\n\\r\\n(I am also, per my previous message, starting another thread for the \\r\\nsymbol not found problem I have in trying to get some applications \\r\\nrunning (synaptic, iceape, geany to name a few).)\\r\\n\\r\\nRegards,\\r\\nDon\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n-- \\r\\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \\r\\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".

For me that\\'s only /etc/, /root/ and\\n/home/. Then you reinstall cleanly, formating \"/\", put your /home/ files\\nback into place and you\\'re ready to go.\\nThat\\'s the moment I usually realize I had a nifty tweak to a file in\\n/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ or some special parameters added to an\\n/etc/modules.conf entry... so I look at my backup and make the same change\\nagain. The only thing where you can get stuck is the grub.conf files,\\nbecause although there\\'s a /etc/grub.conf link, it\\'s actually in\\n/boot/grub/ so you may want to copy it too if you have special kernel\\nparameters to save (I have to pass \"pci=bios,biosirq\" for one of my\\ncomputers to work for example).\\n\\nHTH,\\nMatthias\\n\\n-- \\nMatthias Saou                                World Trade Center\\n-------------                                Edificio Norte 4 Planta\\nSystem and Network Engineer                  08039 Barcelona, Spain\\nElectronic Group Interactive                 Phone : +34 936 00 23 23\\n\\n_______________________________________________\\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\\n\\n\\n'},\n",

Also, I have been granted political stay as a\\nRefugee by the Government of C\\xf4te d'Ivoire.\\n\\nMeanwhile, my father have instructed me to look for a\\ntrusted foreigner who can assist me to move out this\\nmoney from C\\xf4te d'Ivoire immediately for investment .\\nBased on this , I solicit for your assistance to\\ntransfer this fund into your Account, but I will\\ndemand for the following requirement:\\n\\n(1) Could you provide for me a safe Bank Account where\\nthis fund will be transferred to in your country or\\nanother neaarby country where taxation will not\\ntakegreat toll on the money?\\n\\n(2) Could you be able to assist me to obtain my\\ntravelling papers after this transfer to enable me\\ncome over to meet you in your country for\\ntheinvestment of this money?\\n\\n(3) Could you be able to introduce me to a profitable\\nbusiness venture that would not require much technical\\nexpertise in your country where part of this fund\\nwillbe invested?\\n\\nPlease, all these requirements are urgently needed as\\nit will enable me to establish a stronger business\\nrelationship with you hence I will like you to be the\\ngeneral overseer of the investment thereafter. I am a\\nChristian and I will please, want you to handle this\\ntransaction based on the trust I have established\\non you.\\n\\nFor your assistance in this transaction, I have\\ndecided to offer you 12% percent commission of the\\ntotal amount at the end of this business.

Both\\n  >> collections have about 1100 messages.\\n\\n  TP> Does this mean you trained on about 1100 of each?\\n\\nThe total collections are 1100 messages.  I trained with 1100/5\\nmessages. \\n\\n  TP> Can\\'t guess.  You\\'re in a good position to start adding more\\n  TP> headers into the analysis, though.  For example, an easy start\\n  TP> would be to uncomment the header-counting lines in tokenize()\\n  TP> (look for \"Anthony\").  Likely the most valuable thing it\\'s\\n  TP> missing then is some special parsing and tagging of Received\\n  TP> headers.\\n\\nI tried the \"Anthony\" stuff, but it didn\\'t make any appreciable\\ndifference that I could see from staring at the false negative rate.\\nThe numbers are big enough that a quick eyeball suffices.\\n\\nThen I tried a dirt simple tokenizer for the headers that tokenize the\\nwords in the header and emitted like this \"%s: %s\" % (hdr, word).\\nThat worked too well :-).  The received and date headers helped the\\nclassifier discover that most of my spam is old and most of my ham is\\nnew.\\n\\nSo I tried a slightly more complex one that skipped received, data,\\nand x-from_, which all contained timestamps.  I also skipped the X-VM-\\nheaders that my mail reader added:\\n\\nclass MyTokenizer(Tokenizer):\\n\\n    skip = {\\'received\\': 1,\\n            \\'date\\': 1,\\n            \\'x-from_\\': 1,\\n            }\\n\\n    def tokenize_headers(self, msg):\\n        for k, v in msg.items():\\n            k = k.lower()\\n            if k in self.skip or k.startswith(\\'x-vm\\'):\\n                continue\\n            for w in subject_word_re.findall(v):\\n                for t in tokenize_word(w):\\n                    yield \"%s:%s\" % (k, t)\\n\\nThis did moderately better.  The false negative rate is 7-21% over the\\ntests performed so far.  This is versus 11-28% for the previous test\\nrun that used the timtest header tokenizer.\\n\\nIt\\'s interesting to see that the best descriminators are all ham\\ndiscriminators.  There\\'s not a single spam-indicator in the list.\\nMost of the discriminators are header fields.  One thing to note is\\nthat the presence of Mailman-generated headers is a strong non-spam\\nindicator.  That matches my intuition: I got an awful lot of\\nMailman-generated mail, and those lists are pretty good at surpressing\\nspam.  The other thing is that I get a lot of ham from people who use\\nXEmacs.  That\\'s probably Barry, Guido, Fred, and me :-).\\n\\nOne final note.  It looks like many of the false positives are from\\npeople I\\'ve never met with questions about Shakespeare.  They often\\nstart with stuff like:\\n\\n> Dear Sir/Madam,\\n> \\n> May I please take some of your precious time to ask you to help me to find a\\n> solution to a problem that is worrying me greatly.

Sonnets.\\n\\nWilliam Shakespeare (1564-1616) was a famous English poet,\\ndramatist, and actor, often regarded as the greatest English\\nwriter of all time. Shakespeare's early life was spent in\\nStratford-upon-Avon, where little else is known about him\\nuntil he married at age 18 to Anne Hathaway.  He enjoyed\\nquick recognition as a skilled playwright in London as a\\nmember of the Lord Chamberlain's Company (also known as the\\nKing's Men).  He retired in 1610, having spent a successful\\ncareer as a writer and heralded by royalty and peasants\\nalike.\\n\\nShakespeare's privacy resulted in a sketchy timeline of the\\nwriter's life, leading many over the years to attempt to\\nfill in the gaps, often with scraps of fact and fiction that\\nonly result in nothing close to the truth (A truth we will\\nprobably never know).  Among the rumors and hypotheses\\noffered over the years: that he was gay; a womanizer;\\nilliterate (reciting his works to a scribe), and a puppet\\n(in which he didn't write the works but was encouraged to\\ntake credit to shield the real writer -- a person with\\npolitical ties).\\n\\nShakespeare's sonnets give readers a glimpse into the mind\\nand heart of the playwright.  Published in 1609, the 154\\nsonnets involve the author's relationship with various\\ncharacters, including a striking young man, a mysterious\\nwoman, and a rival poet.  The identities of the characters\\nhave also been the subject of much speculation over the\\nyears, despite the fact that they may have been completely\\ncreated in the mind of the bard.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\nBy Mickie Kennedy of http://www.poetrypreviews.com\\nCopyright DayTips.com, Inc., 2002.

Secondly, both groups were located in Australia and whilst one  \\r\\nwas talking about importing an iPad from the US, the other was asking  \\r\\nif they could use it in the UK when they visited family there later in  \\r\\nthe year.\\r\\nSteve Jobs made it abundantly clear in his Keynote speech launching  \\r\\nthe iPad that it was NOT locked to any carrier... yet on both MUG  \\r\\nlists, people responded saying the iPad was likely to be locked in to  \\r\\nAT&T and so the people inquiring would not be able to use the iPad as  \\r\\nthey had hoped... which was just plain wrong!\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I not saying that User Groups always get it wrong... more often  \\r\\nthen not they don\\'t and they do actually provide an independent  \\r\\nviewpoint... for example, the discussion on this very list about how  \\r\\nbest to demo an iPad was very enlightening and provided far more  \\r\\ninformation on the topic then I got out of my contacts at Apple  \\r\\nAustralian (and Apple US) on how do do the same thing when the iPhone  \\r\\nfirst came out here (about 18 months AFTER the US go it - so it wasn\\'t  \\r\\nexactly the latest news then and I\\'m sure others had similar queries  \\r\\nat  the time).\\r\\n\\r\\n> The message of user groups is lost in the scale of the Apple media  \\r\\n> presence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen it is up to User Groups to address that themselves.... which  \\r\\nagain harks back to the original topic of this thread\\r\\n\\r\\nHere in Australia, we have taken steps towards addressing this... I  \\r\\nproduced a full page flyer promoting active Apple User Groups here.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee Page 15 of the Feb/Mar issue of the AppleUsers Spotlight (a 30+  \\r\\npage digital format magazine I publish here in Australia) for an  \\r\\nexample of the ad.\\r\\nhttp://www.appleusers.org/magazine/february-2010-issue-of-appleusers-spotlight-now-available/\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\'electronic\\' copy of the flyer has each user group name as an  \\r\\nactive hyperlink, so people can jump straight to a group in their state.\\r\\nIf it appeared in a printed magazine or flyer, then there is still the  \\r\\nsimple URL that can easily be typed in which lands you at a page with  \\r\\nlinks to the various groups own webpages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\'primary\\' URL used on the flyer was actually put to a vote and  \\r\\neveryone agreed that we wouldn\\'t use the www.apple.com/au/usergroup  \\r\\nlink (or even the www.apple.com.au/usergroup one) as quite a few of  \\r\\nthe \\'active\\' groups here have chosen NOT to be listed there - so they  \\r\\ncan be seen as been independent from Apple (and any other retailer)  \\r\\nand also due to the fact that listing often falls out of date.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI just realised that the ad needs updating - we don\\'t mention the iPad  \\r\\nin the current version :)\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also have a portrait version on hand if we need it... in fact, the  \\r\\nflyer started out as an A4 size portrait flyer when we were approached  \\r\\nto have an ad in one of Australian Macworld\\'s Super Guide publications  \\r\\n- unfortunately we couldn\\'t arrange enough funding to go ahead with  \\r\\nthe idea in the time frame at hand... but now we have a solid basis to  \\r\\nwork from the next time an opportunity presents itself\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is nothing stopping a group of User Groups in a \\'state\\',  \\r\\n\\'region\\' or \\'area\\' from getting together and producing their own  \\r\\nversion of such an ad.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also love what Mac Users UK have done with their Google map showing  \\r\\nthe location of each User Group in the UK (and Ireland)\\r\\nhttp://www.macusersuk.org/mugs/mugsmap.php  I really must work out how  \\r\\nto create such a Map for Australian User Groups :)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n> Let me make an analogy...

They\\'re not getting the limelight, but they sure  \\r\\n> get in\\r\\n> front of lots of people they wouldn\\'t otherwise.\\r\\n>\\r\\n> Not only do we not get secondary stage placement, but we can\\'t even  \\r\\n> hang out\\r\\n> at the gate to the event and have a banner or people handing out  \\r\\n> flyers\\r\\n> about our groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nActually, most \\'concerts\\' and major events organisers discourage  \\r\\n\\'hawkers\\' from \\'hassling\\' people at the gates/entrance... but they\\'ll  \\r\\nquite happily take your groups money and let you have a concession  \\r\\nstand near by (and usually take a percentage of your gross takings as  \\r\\nwell)\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd why should Apple be expected do the marketing for independent User  \\r\\nGroups???\\r\\nYes, I know User Groups \\'promote\\' Apple products... but we have chosen  \\r\\nto do so... we aren\\'t compelled to do so.\\r\\nWe come together in User Groups (or even in online communities such as  \\r\\nthis) to meet with like minded people and discuss things about a  \\r\\ncommon topic of interest to us... just like there are groups that get  \\r\\ntogether as book clubs, or reptile keepers, even \"gunzels\" get  \\r\\ntogether through their common interest in trains (real ones and model  \\r\\nones).  No one makes them form these groups nor force people to  \\r\\nparticipate... and most other \\'hobbies\\' aren\\'t so (un)fortunate to  \\r\\nhave a \\'central\\' business or entity to focus around, yet they survive  \\r\\nand even flourish all by themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\n> Chris\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n--\\r\\nNicholas Pyers (nicholas@appleusers.org)\\r\\nFounder & Publisher, AppleUsers.org\\r\\n\\r\\nhttp://www.appleusers.org/\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n _______________________________________________\\r\\nDo not post admin requests to the list.

You can\\npractically see the laser-sights light up when you walk into a\\nroom...\\n\\nThat\\'s because, of course, most churches are *run* by women. Most\\nregular attendants are women. Hell, 65% of all new *ministers*, in\\nprotestant denominations, at least, are women. No matter your age,\\nlooks, intelligence, whatever, you\\'ll end up surrounded by women.\\nYou\\'ll be outnumbered, even several to one -- some of whom are at\\nleast better looking than you are. :-). The only place where there\\nare *more* women running things is in grass-roots Republican politics\\n- -- but I won\\'t go there, I promise.\\n\\n\\nIf I may make a presumption here, since you brought it up, I figure\\nthat between the sophistication and diversity of the subcontinent\\'s\\nreligions, and the ubiquity of Indians in various stages of\\nassimilation in So/NoCal, you can find some place to hang out near\\nyou, Rohit. You probably don\\'t even have to go, um, native, like I\\ndid -- backsliding on my own ostensibly rational godless upbringing\\nand becoming, horrors, a Unitarian...\\n\\nCheers,\\nRAH\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\\nVersion: PGP 7.5\\n\\niQA/AwUBPYjCBcPxH8jf3ohaEQI2vwCbB2UkMyii/XwKQvvJFSWlMMRheBsAmwUB\\njDmfQrNRQED3LmW6V8YutN54\\n=vQ/A\\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\\n\\n-- \\n-----------------\\nR.

In 1947, \\nthe Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) decided to challenge \\nthe racist system. The opposition was fierce and the riders \\nwere jailed often ending up on chain gangs.\\n\\nBy 1961, the time was right to challenge America\\'s Jim Crow \\nlaws and CORE proposed the \"Freedom Rides.\" CORE felt that \\nthey could count on the racists to oppose the rides thereby \\ncreating a crisis that would force the Federal Government to \\nintervene to enforce the law. It would be dangerous and CORE \\nmembers knew that they were risking their lives, but as CORE \\ndirector James Farmer maintained they were ready.  \"When we \\nbegan the ride I think all of us were prepared for as much \\nviolence as could be thrown at us. We were prepared for the \\npossibility of death.\"\\n  \\n------------------------------------------------------------ \\n\\n            * S E X...S E X...S E X...S E X *\\n            NOW THAT WE\\x92VE GOT YOUR ATTENTION...\\n\\nIntroducing GREAT SEX -- the ONLY pill of its kind fortified \\nwith nature\\'s most POTENT MOOD ENHANCERS.

In the upper \\nsouth they met no resistance but by the time they got to \\nAlabama they were met by an angry band of terrorists who \\nslashed the tires and burned the bus. In Birmingham it was \\nworse. The FBI, through its informant James Rowe, were well \\naware that the Ku Klux Klan was waiting for them. So were \\nthe Birmingham police, led by Chief of police Bull Conner, \\nand when they arrived they were severely beaten. \\n\\nDespite the warnings there were no police to protect them. \\nGovernor Patterson showed no mercy and blamed the riders. \\nSo the terrorist attacks went on. The \"Freedom Riders\" were \\ndetermined to continue and were joined by a group of Nash-\\nville students. They were met by hostility and were arrested \\nand sent back to Tennessee. But the riders were fearless and \\nimmediately returned to Birmingham ready to continue the \\njourney.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------ \\n\\n   ---------> The Paranormal Insider Is Here! <---------\\n\\nShagMail is PROUD to introduce our one and only paranormal \\ninvestigator, Gus.

State officials had promised Attorney General Robert \\nKennedy they would be protected, but by the time they reached \\nMontgomery there were no state police in sight. Seeing a mob, \\nthe riders feared for their lives, but Jim Zwerg, a white man, \\nbravely walked out of the bus and was nearly beaten to death. \\nHe still suffers from the effects but his courage was un-\\ndeniable. Others including Justice Department official John \\nSeigenthaler were also beaten.\\n\\nThe situation seemed to be out of control and federal inter-\\nvention finally saved the day with Governor Patterson declar-\\ning martial law. Robert Kennedy called for a cooling off \\nperiod but the riders refused. They would continue on. So \\nthey set off to Jackson, Mississippi but  Kennedy had made a \\ndeal with Mississippi officials. They were supposed to be \\nprotected, but upon arriving they were arrested.

I am moved to write you this letter. \\n\\nThis was in confidence considering my present circumstance and situation. I escaped along with my husband and two of our sons James Kongolo and Nzanga out of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan, Coted'ivoire where my family and I settled, while we later moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease. However, due to this situation we decided to change most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new head of state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement with the Swiss government and other European countries to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in some european countries. \\n\\nHence, my children and I decided laying low in Africa to study the situation\\ntill when things gets better. Like now that president Kabila is dead and the son taking over\\n(Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's chateaux in Southern France was confiscated by the french government, and as such I had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated.I have deposited the sum Eighteen Million United State\\nDollars (US$18,000,000,00.) With a security company for safe keeping. What I want you to do is to indicate yourinterest that you can assist us in receiving the money on our behalf, so that I can introduce you to my son (Kongolo) who has the out modalities for the claim\\nof the said funds.

       "  'payload': 'Hello\\n\\nYou may have seen this business before and\\nignored it. I know I did - many times! However,\\nplease take a few moments to read this letter.\\nI was amazed when the profit potential of this\\nbusiness finally sunk in... and it works!\\n\\nWith easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,\\nsuccess in this business is now fast, easy and\\nwell within the capabilities of ordinary people\\nwho know little about internet marketing. And the\\nearnings potential is truly staggering!\\n\\nI\\'ll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -\\nfollow what it says to the letter - and you will not\\nworry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is\\nPresident, or whether you keep your current job or not.\\nYes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded\\nto one of these before either. One day though,\\nsomething just said: \"You throw away $25.00 going to\\na movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck.\"\\nBelieve me, no matter where you believe those \"feelings\"\\ncome from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. \\n\\nI cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be\\ndoing had I not. Read on. It\\'s true. Every word of it.\\nIt is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying\\nand selling something of value.\\n\\nAS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:\\n\\nMaking over half a million dollars every 4 to 5\\nmonths from your home.\\n\\nTHANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!\\n==================================================\\nBE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!\\n\\nBefore you say \"Bull\", please read the following.\\nThis is the letter you have been hearing about on the\\nnews lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on\\nthe internet, a national weekly news program recently\\ndevoted an entire show to the investigation of this\\nprogram described below, to see if it really can make\\npeople money. The show also investigated whether or\\nnot the program was legal.\\n\\nTheir findings proved once and for all that there are\\n\"absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in\\nthe program and if people can \\'follow the simple\\ninstructions\\' they are bound to make some mega bucks\\nwith only $25 out of pocket cost\".\\n\\nDUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT\\nTHIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING\\nBETTER THAN EVER.\\n\\nThis is what one had to say: \"Thanks to this\\nprofitable opportunity. I was approached many times\\nbefore but each time I passed on it. I am so glad\\nI finally joined just to see what one could expect\\nin return for the minimal effort and money required.\\nTo my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00\\nin 21 weeks, with money still coming in.\"\\n\\nPam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.\\n==================================================\\nAnother said: \"This program has been around for a\\nlong time but I never believed in it. But one day\\nwhen I received this again in the mail I decided\\nto gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple\\ninstructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the\\nmoney started to come in. First month I only made\\n$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made\\na total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months\\nby re-entering the program, I have made over\\n$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to\\nsuccess in this program is to follow the simple\\nsteps and NOT change anything.\"\\n\\nMore testimonials later but first, =======\\n\\n==== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ====\\n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\\n\\nIf you would like to make at least $500,000 every\\n4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the\\nfollowing...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!\\n\\n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\\n\\nFOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND \\nYOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\n\\n=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====\\n\\nFor each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE\\nREPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the\\nperson whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.\\nMAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP\\nLEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.\\n\\n===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===\\n===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===\\nYou will need all 5 reports so that you can save\\nthem on your computer and resell them.\\nYOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.\\n\\nWithin a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each\\nof the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.\\nSave them on your computer so they will be accessible\\nfor you to send to the 1,000\\'s of people who will\\norder them from you. Also make a floppy of these\\nreports and keep it on your desk in case something\\nhappens to your computer.\\n\\nIMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who\\nare listed next to each report, or their sequence on\\nthe list, in any way other than what is instructed\\nbelow in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out\\non the majority of your profits. Once you\\nunderstand the way this works, you will also\\nsee how it will not work if you change it. \\n\\nRemember, this method has been tested, and if you\\nalter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried\\nto put their friends\\'/relatives\\' names on all five\\nthinking they could get all the money. But it does\\nnot work this way. Believe us, some have tried to\\nbe greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not\\ntry to change anything other than what is instructed.\\nBecause if you do, it will not work for you.\\nRemember, honesty reaps the reward!!! \\n\\nThis IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a\\nproduct for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it\\nas such and you will be VERY profitable in a short\\nperiod of time.\\n\\n1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this\\nadvertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the\\nperson in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through\\nthe cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.\\n\\n2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.\\n\\n3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.\\n\\n4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.\\n\\n5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2\\n\\n6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.\\n\\nPLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address\\nACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.\\n\\n==================================================\\n**** Take this entire letter, with the modified\\nlist of names, and save it on your computer.\\nDO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.\\n\\nSave this on a disk as well just in case you lose\\nany data. To assist you with marketing your business\\non the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will\\nprovide you with invaluable marketing information\\nwhich includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,\\nwhere to find thousands of free classified ads and\\nmuch more. There are 2 primary methods to get this\\nventure going:\\n\\nMETHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY\\n==================================================\\n\\nLet\\'s say that you decide to start small, just to see\\nhow it goes, and we will assume you and those involved\\nsend out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let\\'s also assume\\nthat the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)\\nresponse (the response could be much better but let\\'s\\njust say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send\\nout hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only\\n5,000 each.\\n\\nContinuing with this example, you send out only\\n5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only\\n10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded\\nby sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of\\n50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%\\nresponded with orders. That\\'s 100 people who\\nresponded and ordered Report # 2.\\n\\nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for\\na total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to\\nthat is 1000 orders for Report # 3.\\n\\nThose 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a\\ntotal of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%\\nresponse is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.\\n\\nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each\\nfor a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.\\nThe 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for\\nReport # 5.\\n\\nTHAT\\'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00\\n(half a million dollars).\\n\\nYour total income in this example is: 1..... $50\\n+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000\\n+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00\\n\\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND\\nFIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO\\nMATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL\\nMAKE A LOT OF MONEY!\\n==================================================\\n\\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE\\nORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think\\nfor a moment what would happen if everyone or half\\nor even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000\\ne-mails each or more?\\n\\nThere are over 150 million people on the internet\\nworldwide and counting, with thousands more coming\\nonline every day. Believe me, many people will do\\njust that, and more!\\n\\nMETHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\\n==================================================\\n\\nAdvertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and\\nthere are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.\\nPlacing a lot of free ads on the internet will\\neasily get a larger response. We strongly suggest\\nyou start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you\\ngo along. For every $5 you receive, all you must\\ndo is e-mail them the report they ordered. That\\'s it.\\nAlways provide same day service on all orders.\\n\\nThis will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,\\nwith your name and address on it, will be prompt\\nbecause they cannot advertise until they receive\\nthe report.\\n\\n===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================\\nThe reason for the \"cash\" is not because this is\\nillegal or somehow \"wrong\". It is simply about time.\\nTime for checks or credit cards to be cleared or\\napproved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one\\ncan SEE there is money in the envelope and steal\\nit before it gets to you.\\n\\nORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.\\nNotes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for\\neach report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the\\ncash is concealed by wrapping it in at least\\n2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of\\npaper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report\\nyou are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your\\nname and postal address.\\n\\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW :\\n==================================================\\nREPORT # 1: \"The Insider\\'s Guide To Advertising\\nfor Free On The Net\"\\nOrder Report #1 from:\\n\\nRobert Borowczyk\\nul.

THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time\\nyour name is moved down on the list, you are placed\\nin front of a different report.\\n\\nYou can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which\\nreport people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO\\nGENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS\\nAND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.

Do Not change it in any way.\\nIt works exceedingly well as it is now.\\n\\nRemember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report\\nafter you have put your name and address in\\nReport #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as\\ninstructed above. One of the people you send this\\nto may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your\\nname will be on every one of them. \\n\\nRemember though, the more you send out the more\\npotential customers you will reach. So my friend,\\nI have given you the ideas, information, materials\\nand opportunity to become financially independent.\\n\\nIT IS UP TO YOU NOW !\\n\\n=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============\\n\"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in\\nChicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.\\nCorporation and I make pretty good money. When I\\nreceived this program I grumbled to Jody about\\nreceiving \\'junk mail\\'. I made fun of the whole\\nthing, spouting my knowledge of the population\\nand percentages involved. I \\'knew\\' it wouldn\\'t work.\\nJody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and\\nfew days later she jumped in with both feet. I made\\nmerciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old\\n\\'I told you so\\' on her when the thing didn\\'t work. \\n\\nWell, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had\\nreceived 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she\\nhad received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!\\nI was shocked. I have joined Jody in her \\'hobby\\'.\"\\n\\nMitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois\\n================================================\\n\"Not being the gambling type, it took me several\\nweeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.\\nBut conservative as I am, I decided that the initial\\ninvestment was so little that there was just no way\\nthat I wouldn\\'t get enough orders to at least get\\nmy money back. I was surprised when I found my\\nmedium size post office box crammed with orders.\\nI made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. \\n\\nThe nice thing about this deal is that it does not\\nmatter where people live. There simply isn\\'t a\\nbetter investment with a faster return and so big.\"\\n\\nDan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada\\n=================================================\\n\"I had received this program before. I deleted it,\\nbut later I wondered if I should have given it a try.\\nOf course, I had no idea who to contact to get\\nanother copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed\\nagain by someone else......... 11 months passed then\\nit luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!\\nI made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the\\nmoney came within 22 weeks.\"\\n\\nSusan De Suza, New York, N.Y.\\n=================================================\\n\"It really is a great opportunity to make relatively\\neasy money with little cost to you. I followed the\\nsimple instructions carefully and within 10 days the\\nmoney started to come in. My first month I made $20,\\nin the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the\\nthird month my total cash count was $362,840.00.\\nLife is beautiful, Thanx to internet.\"\\n\\nFred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand\\n=================================================\\n\\nORDER YOUR REPORTS TODAY AND GET STARTED ON YOUR\\nROAD TO FINANCIAL FREEDOM !\\n\\n=================================================\\nIf you have any questions of the legality of this\\nprogram, contact the Office of Associate Director\\nfor Marketing Practices, Federal Trade Commission,\\nBureau of Consumer Protection, Washington, D.C.\\n\\nThis message is sent in compliance of the proposed\\nbill SECTION 301, paragraph (a)(2)(C) of S. 1618. \\n\\n* This message is not intended for residents in the\\nState of Washington, Virginia or California,\\nscreening of addresses has been done to the best\\nof our technical ability.\\n\\n*  This is a one time mailing and this list will\\nnever be used again.\\n-- \\nIrish Linux Users\\' Group: ilug@linux.ie\\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\\n\\n\\n'},\n",

Those who deny such a watershed event take a\\nsuperficially short-term view, and seem to think all is as before simply\\nbecause the sun still rises and sets.\\n\\nThis is a colossal misjudgment. The collapse of the towers, the crashing\\ninto the Pentagon, and the murder of 3,000 Americans \\x97 all seen live in real\\ntime by millions the world over \\x97 tore off a scab and exposed deep wounds,\\nwhich, if and when they heal, will leave ugly scars for decades. The killers\\ndealt in icons \\x97 the choice of 911 as the date of death, targeting the\\nmanifest symbols of global capitalism and American military power, and\\ncentering their destruction on the largest Jewish city in the world. Yes,\\nthey got their symbols in spades, but they have no idea that their killing\\nhas instead become emblematic of changes that they could scarcely imagine.\\n\\nIslamic fundamentalism has proved not ascendant, but static, morally\\nrepugnant \\x97 and the worst plague upon the Arab world since the Crusades. By\\nlurking in the shadows and killing incrementally through stealth, the\\nvampirish terrorists garnered bribes and subsidies through threats and\\nbombs; but pale and wrinkled in the daylight after 9/11, they prove only\\nghoulish not fearsome.\\n\\nThe more the world knows of al Qaeda and bin Laden, the more it has found\\nthem both vile and yet banal \\x97 and so is confident and eager to eradicate\\nthem and all they stand for. It is one thing to kill innocents, quite\\nanother to take on the armed might of an aroused United States. Easily\\ndodging a solo cruise missile in the vastness of Afghanistan may make good\\ntheater and bring about braggadocio; dealing with grim American and British\\ncommandos who have come 7,000 miles for your head prompts abject flight and\\nan occasional cheap infomercial on the run. And the ultimate consequence of\\nthe attacks of September 11 will not merely be the destruction of al Qaeda,\\nbut also the complete repudiation of the Taliban, the Iranian mullocracy,\\nthe plague of the Pakistani madrassas, and any other would-be fundamentalist\\nparadise on earth.\\n\\nForeign relations will not be the same in our generation. Our coalition with\\nEurope, we learn, was not a partnership, but more mere alphabetic\\nnomenclature and the mutual back scratching of Euro-American globetrotters \\x97\\na paper alliance without a mission nearly 15 years after the end of the Cold\\nWar. The truth is that Europe, out of noble purposes, for a decade has\\ninsidiously eroded its collective national sovereignty in order to craft an\\nantidemocratic EU, a 80,000-person fuzzy bureaucracy whose executive power\\nis as militarily weak as it is morally ambiguous in its reliance on often\\ndubious international accords. This sad realization September 11 brutally\\nexposed, and we all should cry for the beloved continent that has for the\\nmoment completely lost its moral bearings. Indeed, as the months progressed\\nthe problems inherent in \"the European way\" became all too apparent:\\npretentious utopian manifestos in lieu of military resoluteness, abstract\\nmoralizing to excuse dereliction of concrete ethical responsibility, and\\nconstant American ankle-biting even as Europe lives in a make-believe Shire\\nwhile we keep back the forces of Mordor from its picturesque borders, with\\nonly a few brave Frodos and Bilbos tagging along. Nothing has proved more\\nsobering to Americans than the skepticism of these blinkered European\\nhobbits after September 11.\\n\\nAmerica learned that \"moderate\" Arab countries are as dangerous as hostile\\nIslamic nations. After September 11, being a Saudi, Egyptian, or Kuwaiti\\nmeans nothing special to an American \\x97 at least not proof of being any more\\nfriendly or hostile than having Libyan, Syrian, or Lebanese citizenship.\\nIndeed, our entire postwar policy of propping up autocracies on the triad of\\ntheir anticommunism, oil, and arms purchases \\x97 like NATO \\x97 belongs to a\\npre-9/11 age of Soviet aggrandizement and petroleum monopolies. Now we learn\\nthat broadcasting state-sponsored hatred of Israel and the United States is\\njust as deadly to our interests as scud missiles \\x97 and as likely to come\\nfrom friends as enemies. Worst-case scenarios like Iran and Afghanistan\\noffer more long-term hope than \"stable regimes\" like the Saudis; governments\\nthat hate us have populations that like us \\x97 and vice versa; the Saudi royal\\nfamily, whom 5,000 American troops protect, and the Mubarak autocracy, which\\nhas snagged billions of American dollars, are as afraid of democratic\\nreformers as they are Islamic fundamentalists. And with good reason: Islamic\\ngovernments in Iran and under the Taliban were as hated by the masses as\\nArab secular reformers in exile in the West are praised and championed.\\n\\nThe post-9/11 domestic calculus is just as confusing. Generals and the\\nmilitary brass call civilians who seek the liberation of Iraq \"chicken\\nhawks\" and worse. Yet such traditional Vietnam-era invective I think rings\\nhollow after September 11, and sounds more like McClellan\\'s shrillness\\nagainst his civilian overseers who precipitously wanted an odious slavery\\nended than resonant of Patton\\'s audacity in charging after murderous Nazis.\\nMore Americans were destroyed at work in a single day than all those\\nsoldiers killed in enemy action since the evacuation of Vietnam nearly 30\\nyears ago. Indeed, most troops who went through the ghastly inferno of\\nVietnam are now in or nearing retirement; and, thank God, there is no\\ngeneration of Americans in the present military \\x97 other than a few thousand\\nbrave veterans of the Gulf, Mogadishu, and Panama \\x97 who have been in\\nsustained and deadly shooting with heavy casualties. Because American\\nsoldiers and their equipment are as impressive as our own domestic security\\nis lax, in this gruesome war it may well be more perilous to work high up in\\nlower Manhattan, fly regularly on a jumbo jet, or handle mail at the\\nPentagon or CIA than be at sea on a sub or destroyer.\\n\\nReal concern for the sanctity of life may hinge on employing rather than\\nrejecting force, inasmuch as our troops are as deadly and protected abroad\\nas our women, children, aged, and civilians are impotent and vulnerable at\\nhome. It seems to me a more moral gamble to send hundreds of pilots into\\nharm\\'s way than allow a madman to further his plots to blow up or infect\\nthousands in high-rises.\\n\\nPolitics have been turned upside down. In the old days, cynical\\nconservatives were forced to hold their noses and to practice a sometimes\\nrepellent Realpolitik. In the age of Russian expansionism, they were loathe\\nto champion democracy when it might usher in a socialist Trojan Horse whose\\nbelly harbored totalitarians disguised as parliamentarians. Thus they were\\nso often at loggerheads with na\\xefve and idealist leftists.\\n\\nNo longer. The end of the specter of a deadly and aggressive Soviet\\nCommunism has revived democratic ideology as a force in diplomacy. Champions\\nof freedom no longer sigh and back opportunistic rightist thugs who promise\\nopen economics, loot their treasuries, and keep out the Russians. Instead,\\neven reactionaries are now more likely to push for democratic governments in\\nthe Middle East than are dour and skeptical leftists. The latter, if\\nmulticulturalists, often believe that democracy is a value-neutral Western\\nconstruct, not necessarily a universal good; if pacifists, they claim\\nnonintervention, not justice, as their first priority. The Right, not the\\nLeft, now is the greater proponent of global freedom, liberation, and\\nidealism \\x97 with obvious domestic ramifications for any Republican president\\nastute enough to tap that rich vein of popular support.\\n\\nAll this and more are the wages of the disaster of September 11 and the\\nsubsequent terrible year \\x97 and yet it is likely that, for good or evil, we\\nwill see things even more incredible in the twelve months ahead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'},\n",

AquilaCalendar is\\n   refreshingly different: you can design your own calendar\\n   windows, choosing from a plethora of basic options (day,\\n   week, month, year, several months together, and so on), customize\\n   your calendar with colors and fonts, and more. To-do lists\\n   and notes-to-self can be added to calendars or you can add a\\n   handy clock and holiday markers, among other options. The\\n   interface fits with the OS X design theme, and makes getting\\n   organized no more difficult than it has to be.

After downloading\\r\\nthe repository lists, it tells me there are no updates -- I am\\r\\nsurprised as I know that Gnome 2.30 is already in testing. Thinking\\r\\nthat it could be a problem with the mirror, I switch to\\r\\nftp.ch.debian.org and update. This time, it does say there are about\\r\\n300 updates.\\r\\n\\r\\nI issue a safe-upgrade, but the electricity goes out just as the\\r\\nupdates begin downloading. After I turn the computer back on, issuing\\r\\na safe-upgrade shows there are no updates! I try to aptitude update\\r\\nbut it thinks that the repositories are already updated, though\\r\\napt-cache show nautilus gives the version 2.28.4. As I was in a hurry\\r\\nat the time, I just deleted /var/lib/apt/lists, so aptitude had no\\r\\nchoice but to really download the lists. After this the safe-upgrade\\r\\nproceeded as usual. I realised after deleting /var/lib/apt/lists that\\r\\nI should have kept a copy, but too late.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the problem is (in a sense) solved, I am curious as to how this\\r\\n(bug?) could have occurred. After all this I checked\\r\\nmirror.cse.iitk.ac.in  and it does have nautilus 2.30.1, so maybe the\\r\\nfirst no-updates scenario was also caused by this bug/problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbhishek\\r\\n--\\r\\nPlease cc me as I am not subscribed to debian-user.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n-- \\r\\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \\r\\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".

So I\\'m not\\n > about to place blame. Just reporting my experience.\\n\\nOne more salvo on X and cut/paste.  X specifies at least two *mechanisms*\\nfor cut/paste, but as usual mandates no *policy*.  Windows and Macintosh\\nhave a slightly different mechanism and one uniform policy.  I\\'m quite\\nsure that Tk implements all PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD selections accurately.\\nThe PRIMARY selection is the one that is tied to the visible selection\\non your X display.  The CLIPBOARD selection is the one with the explicit\\nCopy step, and is the same as what you have on Windows and Macintosh.\\nHowever, exmh throws in support for the cutbuffer mechanism, which is\\nanother archaic mechanism supported at one point (perhaps still today)\\nby versions of emacs.  Exmh has a policy that tries to unify all these\\nmechanisms under one umbrella, and by all reports it is not that great.\\n\\nI would encourage folks to play with those 10 lines of code in\\nText_Selection and report what works well for them.  We may come up\\nwith 8 lines that work for everyone, or perhaps introduce yet another\\nsetting that lets folks choose between a few useful models.  Of course,\\nthat\\'s an admission of policy failure, but I\\'m willing to do that.\\n\\n--\\nBrent Welch\\nSoftware Architect, Panasas Inc\\nPioneering the World\\'s Most Scalable and Agile Storage Network\\nwww.panasas.com\\nwelch@panasas.com\\n\\n\\n\\n_______________________________________________\\nExmh-users mailing list\\nExmh-users@redhat.com\\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users\\n\\n\\n'},\n",

This money was paid from the contract awarded to him by the former Government of Sierra Leone.Since the present Government declared that all the assets of supporters of the former Government of Major John P. Koroma should be frozen, therefore I need your assistance to claim this money out from the security company and transfer to any account you may be interested to nominate. Here,we may end up losing the entire fund if we apply for the payment in our family name due to safety \\r\\nreasons and that is why we need an outside help from you.This is a business I want both of us to handle and it remains top secret since our future depends on this fund. We are prepared to compensate you with 20%If you are \\r\\ncapable of assisting us.As soon as I receive your positive response, I will give you more details as regards the transaction. \\r\\n\\r\\nAwaiting for your kind response. \\r\\n\\r\\nMaster Henry Davis, \\r\\nFor the family.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"},\n",

There are 2 Primary\\nmethods to get this\\nventure going: METHOD # 1: BY\\nSENDING BULK E-MAIL\\nLEGALLY\\n\\n===============================\\n=============\\n\\nLet\\'s say that you decide to start small, just\\nto see how it goes,\\nand we will assume You and those\\ninvolved send out only\\n5,000 e-mails each.  Let\\'s also assume that\\nthe mailing receive\\nonly a 0.2% response (the response could\\nbe much better but\\nlets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many\\npeople will send out\\nhundreds of thousands e-mails instead of\\nonly 5,000 each).\\nContinuing with this example, you send out\\nonly 5,000 e-\\nmails. With a 0.2% response, that is only\\n10 orders for report #\\n1. Those 10 people responded by sending\\nout 5,000 e-mail\\neach for a total of 50,000. Out of those\\n50,000 e-mails only\\n0.2% responded with orders.\\nThat\\'s=100 people responded and ordered\\nReport # 2.\\n\\nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails\\neach for a total of\\n500,000 e-mails.  The 0.2% response to\\nthat is 1000 orders for\\nReport # 3.\\n\\nThose 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails\\neach for a total of 5\\nmillion e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response\\nto that is 10,000\\norders for report #4.  Those 10,000 people\\nsend out 5,000 e-\\nmails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50\\nmillion) e-mails. The\\n0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for\\nReport  # 5.\\nTHAT\\'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5\\nEACH=$500,000.00\\n(half million).\\n\\nYour total income in this example is: 1.....\\n$50 + 2..... $500 +\\n3.....$5,000 + 4 . $50,000 + 5..... $500,000\\n.......

There are a lot of alternatives to hydrocarbon\\nproducts derived from petroleum, but these have often been developed as\\na replacement for petroleum after the technology has been established -\\nthere is a growing industry in plant-derived plastics and lubricants,\\nbut this is to replicate materials that have been previously created \\nmuch more easily within the petrochemical industry.\\n\\nVegetable-derived lubricants have been used. The Russians used sunflower\\noil in the lubrication systems of tanks and trucks during the second world \\nwar, and work is being done in the UK to produce diesel fuel derived from\\nwaste cooking oil from fast-food restaurants. \\n\\nJay's correct in his opinion that vegetable oil is not as durable as \\npetroleum oil, but this is only because of the lack of sophistication \\nof the chemistry involved. Synthetic fuels and lubricants are continuously\\nbeing developed, and I don't see any problems with synthetics ultimately \\nmatching the performance of the more conventional products. As the rock\\noil runs out, plant oil derivatives *will* be developed to fill the\\ngap. In parallel, changes will occur in the designs of the machines to \\ncope with any changes in performance of the lubricants.\\n\\nMy big concern is if the technology were ever to be lost for some reason.\\nRe-creating a petrochemical industry from scratch without petrochemicals\\n(that is, going immediately to plant-based synthetics) would be extremely \\ndifficult, especially if it were necessary to recreate *all* of the\\npetrochemical-derived products (not just lubricants and fuels). I suspect\\nthat, bearing in mind the ingenuity of the human race, it would happen,\\njust at a different pace. Imagine an industrial revollution based on,\\nfor example, methane from pig manure, or diesel oil from sunflowers.\\n\\nAll we would then have to do is get used to all the machines smelling\\nlike pig farms and fish and chip shops...\\n\\nRobin Hill, STEAMY BESS, Brough, East Yorkshire\\n\\n\\n\\n********************************************************************\\nThis email and any attachments are confidential to the intended\\nrecipient and may also be privileged.

       "  'payload': \" fork ,\\n\\nFrom;Mr.David  Kargbou and Family,\\n         Johannesburg,South Africa.\\n\\nMy Dear ,\\n\\nGood day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.\\nMy name is Mr.David  Kargbou,the second son of Mr.Smith Thabo Kargbou,of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the la\\n st undemocratic elections decided to block and confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.\\nDuring my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Seven Million and Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$7.400.000.00]in a Trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and bloc\\n ked by the present Mugabe's regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.\\n\\nNow this is what I actually want you to do for me;\\n\\n1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.\\n2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. \\nPlease,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.\\n\\nBest Regards, \\n\\nMr.David Kargbou and family. \\n\\n\\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\\n\\n\\n\"},\n",

But the two new species,\\notiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously known\\nnorth of Switzerland, are now prevalent in south London. \"It\\'s very likely\\nthese weevils have been introduced to Britain through imported ornamental\\nplants from Italy,\" said Dr Barclay. \"It looks like they\\'re here to stay.\"\\nHe found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a Chelsea department store\\nin 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was a\\nmigrant. It has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil in\\nsouth-west London. The second invader is not so numerous, but has\\nestablished itself firmly in the same area.\\nApart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, and\\ngrape vines. An early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. The\\nsoil-dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface.\\nOne possible explanation for the invaders\\' successful colonisation of\\nBritain is global warming.

In 1947, \\nthe Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) decided to challenge \\nthe racist system. The opposition was fierce and the riders \\nwere jailed often ending up on chain gangs.\\n\\nBy 1961, the time was right to challenge America\\'s Jim Crow \\nlaws and CORE proposed the \"Freedom Rides.\" CORE felt that \\nthey could count on the racists to oppose the rides thereby \\ncreating a crisis that would force the Federal Government to \\nintervene to enforce the law. It would be dangerous and CORE \\nmembers knew that they were risking their lives, but as CORE \\ndirector James Farmer maintained they were ready.  \"When we \\nbegan the ride I think all of us were prepared for as much \\nviolence as could be thrown at us. We were prepared for the \\npossibility of death.\"\\n  \\n------------------------------------------------------------ \\n\\n            * S E X...S E X...S E X...S E X *\\n            NOW THAT WE\\x92VE GOT YOUR ATTENTION...\\n\\nIntroducing GREAT SEX -- the ONLY pill of its kind fortified \\nwith nature\\'s most POTENT MOOD ENHANCERS.

In the upper \\nsouth they met no resistance but by the time they got to \\nAlabama they were met by an angry band of terrorists who \\nslashed the tires and burned the bus. In Birmingham it was \\nworse. The FBI, through its informant James Rowe, were well \\naware that the Ku Klux Klan was waiting for them. So were \\nthe Birmingham police, led by Chief of police Bull Conner, \\nand when they arrived they were severely beaten. \\n\\nDespite the warnings there were no police to protect them. \\nGovernor Patterson showed no mercy and blamed the riders. \\nSo the terrorist attacks went on. The \"Freedom Riders\" were \\ndetermined to continue and were joined by a group of Nash-\\nville students. They were met by hostility and were arrested \\nand sent back to Tennessee. But the riders were fearless and \\nimmediately returned to Birmingham ready to continue the \\njourney.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------ \\n\\n   ---------> The Paranormal Insider Is Here! <---------\\n\\nShagMail is PROUD to introduce our one and only paranormal \\ninvestigator, Gus.

State officials had promised Attorney General Robert \\nKennedy they would be protected, but by the time they reached \\nMontgomery there were no state police in sight. Seeing a mob, \\nthe riders feared for their lives, but Jim Zwerg, a white man, \\nbravely walked out of the bus and was nearly beaten to death. \\nHe still suffers from the effects but his courage was un-\\ndeniable. Others including Justice Department official John \\nSeigenthaler were also beaten.\\n\\nThe situation seemed to be out of control and federal inter-\\nvention finally saved the day with Governor Patterson declar-\\ning martial law. Robert Kennedy called for a cooling off \\nperiod but the riders refused. They would continue on. So \\nthey set off to Jackson, Mississippi but  Kennedy had made a \\ndeal with Mississippi officials. They were supposed to be \\nprotected, but upon arriving they were arrested. Kennedy had \\ncaved in. It was a cowardly decision by the Attorney General \\nand the riders were sentenced for 60 days for exercising \\ntheir constitutional rights. They never finished their trip \\nbut their courage showed the power of civil disobedience and \\nin the end justice would prevail and terrorism would be \\ndefeated. It is another example of how people change things, \\nnot government officials.\\n\\nSources: Eyes on the Prize\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------ \\nQuestions...Comments..Email us at: mailto:denis@shagmail.com \\n<a href=\"mailto:denis@shagmail.com\">Email Forgotten History</a> \\n************************************************************ \\n\\nTo SUBSCRIBE visit: http://www.shagmail.com/sub/history.html \\n*** \\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE visit: http://www.shagmail.com/unsub/history.html \\n*** \\nWant some Fun and Amusements in your email box FREE!

Each with their own brand of attitude, to be\\nsure, but they seem to be pretty focused on actually helping things move\\nforward.  How is that being monstrous?\\n\\nIs Dave trying to slander their good names and thus poison the public\\'s\\nperception of them?

When normal people don\\'t understand something\\nthey usually try learning about it.  They read up, ask questions and seek\\nthe help of those that understand it.  This before shooting their mouths off\\nand looking like fools.\\n\\nWhat Dave does is just the opposite.\\n\\nPosts a link to something he doesn\\'t understand\\nGet\\'s a bunch of e-mail from people who do understand it\\nDerides the idea as being \\'too much trouble\\' and blogs it.\\nExpects others to do research for him\\nAbuses anyone who tries to help him\\nPontificates, incorrectly, about only part of the issue\\nRealizes he\\'s been a fool but refuses to correct himself\\nPlods forward pedantically trying to defend his idiocy\\nTries making the educated people look like fools.\\nSends private e-mails to them trying to scare them off.\\nExposes any private e-mail they write, out of context.\\nDeflects and runs off to some new topic, repeats from #1\\nHis continued diatribes about RSS-1.0 and it\\'s use of RDF reveal this to be\\ntrue.  Dave doesn\\'t get the idea of the semantic web.  He\\'d rather have you\\nfollow his stupid ideas than dare admit that the work of others is worth\\ntrying.\\n\\nOne reader wrote to us with a good analogy.  \"It\\'s like that movie The\\nPoseidon Adventure.  Dave\\'s like the purser ranting and raving that the\\npassengers should follow him and march toward the bow.  I don\\'t know about\\nyou but I\\'d rather be with the fat lady swimming toward the engine room.\\nThe ship\\'s fucking sinking and I don\\'t want to be following the idiot.\"\\n\\nDave\\'s idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach\\naround.

Some backing down by the whining one?\\n\\n\\nIt would appear the \\'dictator release\\' strategy that Dave\\'s been trying on\\nhis crappy little set of RSS hacks is failing to gain support.\\n\\nI\\'m going to push back the caveat-removing on the 2.0 spec by 24 hours.\\nStill have work to do on the sample file, I want to look into the RFC for\\ntime-date specs, and get started on the Radio implementation of 2.0. I have\\nto prepare for Seybold tomorrow, and I want to a little memorial for 9-11. A\\nbusy few days for a guy still recovering. Also, it would be great if people\\nwho make content tools could review the 2.0 spec and see if there are any\\ndeal-stoppers.\\n\\nHell yeah there are deal stoppers, like nobody wants it nor will they use\\nit!\\n\\nThe poor Radio customers!  The poor Salon blog users!  They\\'re going to be\\ndragged unwillingly into producing XML content that nobody will use!  So\\nwith the flip of his mighty upgrade switch Dave is going to turn all their\\ncontent into totally unsupported garbage!!!\\n\\nYa better speak up now folks otherwise your content is going to start\\ngetting rejected!\\n\\nOf course at the same time Dave tries to play the sympathy card.  What utter\\nfucking nonsense.  This past weekend, the blogosphere excoriates him for his\\n\\'blame America\\' bullshit.  Then the RSS community tells him to get stuffed\\nwith his dictator release of RSS.

We\\'ll still kick your ass regardless.  That\\'s what years of your\\nabusing people has gotten you Dave.  No sympathy anymore, none whatsoever.\\n\\n\\n 9/11/02; 1:56:10 PM - Discuss\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDave is Scary on 9/11\\n\\nPosted on Scripting News on 9/10/2002:\\n\\n\\nNote: During the day tomorrow there will be no updates to Scripting News.\\nI\\'ll be in SF at Seybold, leading a discussion on Web Services for\\nPublishing with people from Amazon, Apple, Google and Jake Savin of\\nUserLand. I may be able to update my Radio weblog, but only if there\\'s\\nsomething really important to report. So best wishes for a happy and safe\\n9-11.\\nWhat kind of asshole wishes people a happy 9/11??!?!?!?!??!! Obviously\\nsomeone who doesn\\'t have a clue nor lost anyone in the tragedy.\\n\\n\\n 9/11/02; 7:56:06 AM - Discuss\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYeow and we though we were harsh!\\n\\n\\nWow, apparently Dave\\'s sticking his neck out quite far these days.  Craig\\nSchamp practically keel-hauls him with this one.  He wraps it up with:\\n\\nThe man seems to show over and over that he\\'s nothing more than a whining\\nbuffoon\\n\\nGive that man an honorary Zaphodim membership card and secret decoder ring!\\n\\nRelated links over at PhotoDude, Richard Bennett, Andrea Harris, Reid Stott,\\nJeff Jarvis, Ipse Dixit, and the Fat Guy.\\n\\n\\n 9/9/02; 12:29:45 PM - Discuss\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRSS 2.0: code name \"Hitler\"\\n\\n\\nIf Dave tries to steamroll RSS 2.0 through without formal community\\nconsensus, here now we call it the \"Hitler\" release of 2.0.\\n\\n\"No objections\"?  No, he means \"No objections I choose to hear.\"\\n\\nDave is simply not listening.  People are objecting all over.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 9/6/02; 9:00:02 AM - Discuss\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReferral log funnies\\n\\n\\nEvery now and then we check the referral logs to see what\\'s pointing back to\\nus.  We sincerely apologize to the pool soul that used this search.\\n\\n\\n 9/5/02; 12:15:07 PM - Discuss\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLuserland Attempts to Trademark \"RSS\"\\n\\n\\nDave has waxed and waned about intellectual property rights and how any\\nBigCo that tries to patent its technology or methods is corrupt or morally\\nbankrupt. Scripting News is full of examples.\\n\\nSo we found it surprising, as did many others, when Luserland software tried\\nto patent the term \\'RSS\\' back in 2000. Here\\'s the patent application:\\n\\nhttp://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=78025336\\n\\nThis was apparently just between the start of the RSS 1.0 development\\nefforts, and the publication of the specification. Winer knew about the RSS\\n1.0 stuff - indeed, he complained about it bitterly at the time.\\n\\nCould Dave be any more transparent?!?!??!?!!!!!!!\\n\\nSince when has Dave been required to follow anything he says he wants others\\nto do??? A good quote from before he filed the patent application:\\n\\nTim O\\'Reilly says patents are OK, he\\'s just against stupid patents. In the\\nspirit of Touch of Grey, Tim man, patents are lock-in of the worst kind.\\nThere\\'s no way to route around them.\\n\\n 9/4/02; 6:06:51 AM - Discuss\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen\\'s a Permalink not a Permalink?\\n\\n\\nWhen Dave writes an item, then removes it!!!!!!!!!!! The permalink links to\\nnothing at that point. So apparently the \"perma-\" part in permalink is\\npermanent. For everyone except Dave.

(It is\\namazing what one can achieve when mains power fails, long enough for\\nUPS\\'s to run out, and all that is left operational is the laptop and\\nits battery supply...)\\n\\nFirst, I put in some defensive code into the area where the problem was\\noccurring, so that if exmh is attempting (for any reason) to expand a\\nsequence that isn\\'t either a number, or a range of numbers (or a list of\\nsuch things) it will simply ignore the trash, rather than giving a traceback.\\nThis one solves the initial problem:\\n\\n--- mh.tcl.WAS\\tThu Aug 22 21:15:06 2002\\n+++ mh.tcl\\tWed Aug 28 12:39:11 2002\\n@@ -487,6 +487,10 @@\\n     set seq {}\\n     set rseq {}\\n     foreach range [split [string trim $sequence]] {\\n+\\tif ![regexp {^[0-9]+(-[0-9]+)?$} $range] {\\n+\\t    # just ignore anything bogus\\n+\\t    continue;\\n+\\t}\\n \\tset parts [split [string trim $range] -]\\n \\tif {[llength $parts] == 1} {\\n \\t    lappend seq $parts\\n\\n\\nThat is amending proc MhSeqExpand which is where the error was occurring\\nbefore (the code assumes that $range is either NNN or NNN-MMM so we should\\nprobably make sure that\\'s true - issue an error instead of just \"continue\"\\nif you like, but I don\\'t think an error is needed).\\n\\nBut that just allowed me to create a similar problem, in another place,\\nby typing \"NNN-\" ... and rather than continue to fight fires like this,\\nI thought I should think more about Brent\\'s suggestion.   But rather than\\nhave the selection code actually validate the input, which would mean it\\nwould have to know what is to be valid, I decided that the right thing to\\ndo is just to ignore any errors caused by invalid input, so I just stuck\\na \"catch\" around the MsgShow that is processing the nonsense that the\\nuser has typed.\\n\\nThis way, any later expansion to what MsgShow treats as legal (maybe\\nallowing a sequence name, like \"prev\" or \"next\", or anything else can\\nbe handled just there, without someone needing to remember that they have\\nto go fix the selection processing code to allow it.\\n\\nBut, while I was playing there, I noticed something I never new before.\\nIf you type \"66+\" the \"66\" changes to \"67\" (and so on, for each + that\\nis typed).   I suspect that\\'s perhaps an artifact of \"+ is bound to a\\ndifferent function so it can be used as a toggle between changing the\\ncurrent and the target folder, but it has to mean something if the current\\ninput mode is a message number, so let it mean...\", but now I found it,\\nI think its nice.    But if we can type 66+ why not 66- as well?  That\\nkind of limitation bugs me, so I fixed it.\\n\\nAnd then I wondered about folders with names containing \\'+\\' - the special\\nuse of + as the toggle character means there\\'s no way to type those from\\nthe keyboard.   So I fixed that as well.   This makes two different\\nrestrictions - there\\'s no way to type a folder name that has a name\\nbeginning with \\'+\\' (but such a thing in MH would be a pain to use anyway,\\nso I doubt this will bother anyone), and it is now only possible to\\ntoggle between typing the current & target folder name when the name\\nbeing typed is empty.   I\\'m less happy about that part, but I think I\\ncan live with it in order to allow folder names with +\\'s in them to\\nexist and be typed.\\n\\nThen, since I was there anyway, I decided to do something about another\\nfeature that has always bugged me.   In \"normal\" keyboard mode, \\'s\\' is\\nthe key used to show a message.    But if you\\'ve just typed 123, and\\nthe FTOC is highlighting 123 as the current message, and you want to now\\nshow that message, you can\\'t type \\'s\\', you have to type \\\\r instead.\\nSo I \"fixed\" this one as well.   \"Fixed\" here is in quotes, as it assumes\\nthat the keybinding for MsgShow is \\'s\\', if you change that to something\\nelse, it will remain \\'s\\' in here.   I don\\'t know enough tk/tcl to have it\\ndiscover what key is bound to a function in the external world in order\\nto bind the same one here.   \\\\r continues to work of course.\\n\\nAnd now I got started in fixing irritants in this code, I also made it\\nclear the status line if you abort message/folder entry mode (^C or ^G).\\nPreviously it used to leave the prompt sitting there until the next\\nmessage appeared, which made it less than obvious that the keyboard had\\nreverted to its usual bindings.\\n\\nIn any case, what follows is the patch that does all of that.   I believe\\nthat if you apply this, then the one above is probably not needed, the\\n\"catch\" around the \"MsgShow\" will hide the problem (I don\\'t think we really\\nneed to fix Brent\\'s way of invoking it).   Or include it anyway, just\\nfor completeness (I haven\\'t run an exmh with the following patch, but not\\nthe previous one, so I don\\'t know for sure that all will be OK then).\\n\\nkre\\n\\n--- select.tcl.WAS\\tThu Aug 22 21:15:07 2002\\n+++ select.tcl\\tWed Aug 28 13:36:17 2002\\n@@ -49,9 +49,11 @@\\n     bindtags $w [list $w Entry]\\n     bind $w <Any-Key>\\t{SelectTypein %W %A}\\n     bind $w <Key-plus>\\t{SelectToggle %W }\\n+    bind $w <Key-minus>\\t{SelectPrev %W }\\n     bind $w <space>\\t{SelectComplete %W}\\n     bind $w <Tab>\\t{SelectComplete %W}\\n     bind $w <Return>\\t{SelectReturn %W}\\n+    bind $w <Key-s>\\t{SelectReturn %W %A}\\n     bind $w <BackSpace>\\t{SelectBackSpace %W}\\n     bind $w <Control-h>\\t{SelectBackSpace %W}\\n     bind $w <Delete>\\t{SelectBackSpace %W}\\n@@ -72,7 +74,7 @@\\n     append select(sel) $a\\n     Exmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\"\\n     if ![info exists select(folder)] {\\n-\\tMsg_Change $select(sel) noshow\\n+\\tcatch { Msg_Change $select(sel) noshow }\\n     }\\n }\\n proc SelectBackSpace { w } {\\n@@ -91,6 +93,10 @@\\n proc SelectToggle {w} {\\n     global select\\n     if [info exists select(folder)] {\\n+\\tif {$select(sel) != \"\"} {\\n+\\t    SelectTypein $w +\\n+\\t    return\\n+\\t}\\n \\tset select(toggle) [list [lindex $select(toggle) 1] [lindex $select(toggle) 0]]\\n \\tset select(prompt) \"[lindex $select(toggle) 0] Folder:\"\\n     } else {\\n@@ -101,6 +107,18 @@\\n     }\\n     Exmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\"\\n }\\n+proc SelectPrev {w} {\\n+    global select\\n+    if [info exists select(folder)] {\\n+\\tSelectTypein $w \"-\"\\n+    } else {\\n+\\tcatch {\\n+\\t    incr select(sel) -1\\n+\\t    Msg_Change $select(sel) noshow\\n+\\t}\\n+        Exmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\"\\n+    }\\n+}\\n proc SelectComplete { w } {\\n     global select\\n     if [info exists select(folder)] {\\n@@ -126,9 +144,13 @@\\n \\tExmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\"\\n     }\\n }\\n-proc SelectReturn { w } {\\n+proc SelectReturn { w {a {}} } {\\n     global select\\n     if [info exists select(folder)] {\\n+\\tif {$a != {}} {\\n+\\t    SelectTypein $w $a\\n+\\t    return\\n+\\t}\\n \\tif [info exists select(match)] {\\n \\t    set select(sel) $select(match)\\n \\t    unset select(match)\\n@@ -151,6 +173,7 @@\\n \\tunset select(folder)\\n     }\\n     $select(entry) configure -state disabled\\n+    Exmh_Status \"\"\\n     Exmh_Focus\\n }\\n proc SelectClear { w } {\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_______________________________________________\\nExmh-workers mailing list\\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers\\n\\n'},\n",

The AnchorDesk Weekly newsletter will continued to be published every Friday\\n<p>\\nWhy are we doing this? There are several reasons, but the most important one is giving me a chance do more than just sit behind a desk typing all day in order to meet deadlines.  I\\'ve been writing five columns a week for 18 months now, and I\\'d be lying to you if I didn\\'t admit to being more than a little tired.  \\n<p>\\nAlso, I\\'ve been on such a short leash that I haven\\'t been able to travel or meet as many people as I\\'d like. This new schedule means I\\'ll have more time to get out, learn more, see more products, and discover new issues or trends. So it should result in a more interesting and useful AnchorDesk for you.\\n<p>\\nHaving additional time also means I will be able to work on several projects I\\'ve been assigned, including one that could bear fruit at the Consumer Electronics Show next January. More about that soon, once all the details are nailed down.\\n<p>\\nFor now, the new schedule is being called a \"test,\" which means it could turn out to be temporary--or maybe not. We\\'ll run it through the end of the summer and see how it works. \\n<p>\\nI appreciate your continued support of AnchorDesk. While the column will be less frequent, I will still be on <a href=\"http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=00-4FQlI9QDB2t8PBibgi4cHr7W6TiR\" >CNET Radio</a> every weekday at noon PT (or on-demand streaming anytime) and hope you will join me there.\\n<p>\\nSincerely,\\n<p>\\n\\nDavid Coursey<br>\\nExecutive Editor<br>\\nAnchorDesk\\n\\n\\n   <p>\\n   \\n\\n\\t\\n   <br>\\n   <img

In an interview with InfoWorld Test Center\\nDirector Steve Gillmor and InfoWorld Editor at Large Ed Scannell at\\nMicrosoft Fusion 2002, Ballmer discussed the progress of .Net, changes\\nin the company\\'s approach to product development, and Microsoft\\'s\\nefforts to simplify product licensing and inspire trust in customers and\\npartners.\\n\\n> Last time we talked was two years ago, at the beginning of the .Net\\n> era. So where are we now in the .Net evolution?\\n\\nLet me start by talking about where I think we are in the XML revolution\\nfirst, and then [I will] talk about where we are with .Net. I believe\\nthat the IT industry collectively decided over the last three or four\\nyears that the world was going to be replatformed with XML as the key\\nfoundation. It\\'s not like anyone ever got together to decide this, but\\nit\\'s like magnetic north, where it\\'s been clearly indicated that\\neveryone is rallying around the concept. But I think the degree to which\\n[XML] is pervasive might still be underestimated. A lot of partners,\\neven at this conference, see it as b-to-b for big companies. But it is\\nreally about the way software in general is designed. It is all about\\nthe way security should work. Management -- everything is changed.\\n\\nSo to answer your direct question, two years ago I might have said the\\njury is still out about whether [XML] was going to happen. We were\\nquestioning if it was going to be a legitimate competitor to Java. But\\nnow the world has decided to embrace [XML] as the basis for the next\\ngeneration of technology. And there are a lot of benefits that come with\\nit. Could it have been something other than XML? Sure it could have. It\\nwasn\\'t the specific technical implementation; it is merely the fact that\\nit comes out of Internet standards. It has deeper semantic abilities. It\\nis all about interoperability and connection.\\n\\nSo in that context, where are we with .Net? I\\'ll say a couple\\nthings. No. 1, I would say we have some momentum in the market. We have\\ncustomers using the .Net product line, like Merrill [Lynch], Credit\\nSuisse, Marks & Spencer, CitiBank, and a variety of others. People who\\nare doing some things for real. I feel like the degree we are out front\\nis in some ways smaller and in some ways larger.\\n\\n> How so?\\n\\nSmaller in the sense that everyone is talking the XML talk, even Sun;\\nbigger in the execution sense: We\\'ve delivered. We delivered the first\\nbatch of products that really were built XML to the core -- Visual\\nStudio .Net and BizTalk Server -- and we are getting traction. So I feel\\ngood about where our execution is relative to everyone else. That is not\\nto say that other people aren\\'t doing some reasonable bolt-on XML\\nsupport for the stuff they have.\\n\\n> You have some heavy lifting to do to convince your customers and\\n> partners to follow along. What do you have to do to set the standard\\n> for adoption and upgrading to this next generation?\\n\\nWe have to present the picture that we are behaving consistently within\\nthe framework of focusing on customer issues and customer satisfaction\\nand trustworthy computing, which we have articulated. Now there are some\\nthings I would have done differently, in 20-20 hindsight. I would have\\nincreased the focus on not just security but deployment, because a lot\\nof the security problems are actually deployment problems. We have the\\nfix, but sometimes we can\\'t get the tools in their hands to deploy those\\nfixes fast enough. Licensing -- I know I would have given more time, and\\nthere are better ways to plan around the kinds of changes we made. We\\nare still going to have to get smart about the full ramifications.\\n\\n> Do you expect any changes to be made between now and July 31 to\\n> Licensing 6.0? There is a lot of push-back on this.\\n\\nNo, there is nothing that will happen between now and July 31. And we\\nwill continue to learn over time what we need to do to earn our\\ncustomers\\' trust and earn their business. I think many of the people who\\nare pushing back really don\\'t even know the new terms.\\n\\n> Isn\\'t that your fault for not educating them?\\n\\nYes, it is our fault. But you meet with plenty of customers whose\\ncompanies already have licenses, and they are saying, \\'I think there\\'s a\\nproblem.\\' I don\\'t deny there are some problems. I am sure there are some\\nissues we will have to work on over time.\\n\\nAfter July 31 we are going to see what the real issues are. I was\\ntalking to a customer at the show who was saying he thought there would\\nbe a problem, and I told him that we just completed a deal with his\\ncompany and that he is now universally licensed and that total costs to\\nhis company are now lower than they were before. And he said, \\'Oh really?\\'\\n\\nSo we\\'ll go through July 31. We have a lot of customers who have signed\\nlicenses, and I am sure we are going to find some issues. My bigger\\nconcerns today are probably not in the larger accounts, but there may be\\nsome issues we need to address among the smaller-size companies, and we will.\\n\\n> How does the .Net initiative change the way in-house client and server\\n> developers work together? \\n\\nWhat we are trying to do for the health of .Net and the health of the\\ncompany and the sanity of the people who work there and the quality of\\nthe products we produce is to have a more orchestrated, \\xb8ber-road map\\nof where we are going.\\n\\nNow there are two things a road map can be. One is just a piece of paper\\nthat tells what everyone is doing and records a bunch of bottom-up\\nplans. Or it can be something where we impose more broadly our vision\\nfrom the top. We are not going to try to get everything shared. ...\\nThat\\'s a path for getting everything stopped up. But at the same time we\\nare trying to take the top four or five things we are trying to do in\\nthe Longhorn wave, Yukon wave, or the .Net wave and really have enough\\ntime to have some cross-cutting discussions about how we make that happen.\\n\\nBill [Gates] is dedicated full-time to being chief software\\narchitect.

Is this an\\n> evolution of the solutions approach? \\n\\nI would say it is a pretty direct extrapolation from the solutions\\nstuff, only I think we are just getting a little more experience. I\\nthink we use the word scenarios more often and solutions less, because\\nsolution sounds more like a fixed thing. At the end of the day, most of\\nthe things we do are customizable and programmable, and so people make\\nthem into the solution they want. But they are still scenarios. What\\nwill software deployment look like? Well, that is a scenario because it\\ninvolves Windows, Office, and other applications.\\n\\nWe are working hard to make sure the whole is bigger than the sum of the\\nparts. That\\'s not to say people are always comfortable with this. I\\ncan\\'t even say we will do it perfectly. All we have to do is do it a lot\\nbetter than we had been doing it. I think that would be a big step\\nforward for the customers.\\n\\n> Will this approach cut down on some of the technology civil wars\\n> Microsoft has had in the past involving who is going to gain control of\\n> a project? This seems to be a very democratic approach to development.\\n\\nI would not use the word democracy to describe it. People have to come\\ntogether and ultimately make some decisions. This is not a voting\\nprocess here, the agenda of what we think is important. We get a lot of\\ninput. [But] once it is decided, people don\\'t get to vote with their feet.\\n\\nWe try to make a quantum leap here in terms of our ability to improve\\npulling together all the pieces. Our customers want us to do\\nthat. Simplifying concepts by unifying them. The customers don\\'t say\\nthey want us to do that, but when we do do that, they go, \\'Ahhh, I get\\nit. That makes sense.\\'\\n\\nI don\\'t want to go to six more meetings where people say, \\'Is your\\nworkflow strategy BizTalk?\\' ... Or \\'What\\'s your Office workflow\\nstrategy?\\' Or \\'Why is synchronization in some ways better for e-mail and\\nOutlook than it is for file folders and Web pages?\\'\\n\\nTo get that sort of synchronization sometimes -- to get that high-level\\nroad map to work -- you have to build something we don\\'t have today. So\\nwe have been talking about unifying storage. And so the best way to get\\nall this stuff to work is to get them all to work just one way. Then you\\njust keep tuning one set of parameters instead of having a thousand\\nflowers blooming.\\n\\n> In your Fusion keynote today, you talked about who your competitors\\n> are, and it was the usual suspects. But one you didn\\'t mention is\\n> yourself. You are competing against the last generation of your technology.\\n\\nAlways. Given that our stuff doesn\\'t wear out or break down -- you can\\nquestion whether it breaks or not [Ballmer grins] -- but it doesn\\'t\\nbreak down like machinery does. To get anyone to do something new, we\\nhave to have something interesting and innovative.\\n\\nPeople think, OK, should we just do more upgrades or try to sell more\\nnew product? We decided that users like us to do a level of systems\\nintegration so they don\\'t have to get involved in that. So take\\nSharepoint Team Services, which we put in Office. We could have sold\\nTeam Services as a separate product, and we could have introduced a new\\nSKU [stock keeping unit]. We could have decided if it should work down\\nlevel with the old Office or just the new version of Office, and we\\ncould do that with real-time communications. But we tend to like to put\\nthings together, integrate them, and then release batches?1202?-- which\\nare then \\'upgrades\\' -- as a form of introducing our new innovation. But\\nno matter how you do it, because our stuff does not wear out, we have to\\nconvince people that some idea we have is better or more powerful than\\nthe older idea we had.\\n\\nAnd there are two aspects of doing that. One aspect is, on a given\\nproduct or upgrade release, does that make sense? Or do we convince you\\nthat over an nyear period of time we will have enough innovation that\\nyou will want to be licensed for that innovation. And this is part of\\nthis whole licensing discussion we are having.\\n\\nWe moved to the new licensing for two reasons, I would say. No. 1, we\\nwanted to simplify our licensing. When we look back a year from now, I\\nguarantee you that where we are now is simpler than where we\\nwere. Nothing is simpler during a transition because they are learning\\nthe new and are more familiar with the old, but I think people will\\neventually realize this is simpler. Our licensing got pretty complicated\\nover the years, and some people came to not understand it all.\\n\\nThe other issue is [the timing of delivering] our innovation. I don\\'t\\nwant to have a lot of rough questions [from customers]. So when we do\\nhave new ideas, it\\'s like, OK, should we put it in this upgrade or that\\none or just have a stream of stuff that only our best customers have\\naccess to under the terms of their contract? I think in the long run we\\nhave a better chance of satisfying them with the latter than with\\nhitting them with six different upgrades. I am a fan of [letting] the\\ncustomer decide, OK, I want that piece or this piece. But they are\\nlicensed for all of it. So those are the two things we sought to do.\\n\\n> That gets back to the trust issue, where if you front-load it, that\\'s\\n> the big, lumpy upgrade; and if you back-load it with the vision, the\\n> .Net 2003 servers, you have a long gap in the middle where you have to\\n> sell into an untrusting audience.\\n\\nThe truth is, we need to be better at both. There are some things you\\ncan only do big and lumpy, like a new file system. It\\'s not like some\\nsort of small user feature; if you change the file system, then the\\nstorage, the backup, probaby those things are going to change. Probably\\nthe shell ought to change.The applications ... a lot of things are going\\nto change. Can you call that lumpy? Or you can put out four new features\\nin PowerPoint, sure -- that would not look lumpy to users.\\n\\nI think we have to build trust in the model, and we are going to have to\\ndeliver more over time. It will not come overnight. People will have to\\nsee that we do a few things, ... that not all of our innovation is\\nlumpy, that more of it comes evenly and steadily. People develop a\\nconfidence and faith; they like both aspects of the model. Over time,\\nour support needs to become more intimately involved in that story.\\n\\nWe know that, but we don\\'t know exactly what that means yet. And this\\nwhole notion of software as a service -- this is not a licensing or\\nbusiness discussion. It\\'s how does software get rearchitected in the\\nworld of the Internet? I mean, how many software products are\\nfundamentally different because of the Internet? Not many. Probably the\\nanti-virus guys keep up the best. They are always feeding new virus\\nsupport in. I asked the audience [at Fusion] how many use Windows\\nUpdate. Now that\\'s a small piece of software, but it is big. That\\'s the\\nconsumer market; we\\'ve got to get that to really purr in the corporate market.\\n\\n> The lack of broadband build-out and adoption seems to be holding up\\n> the ability for users to take advantage of some new services you\\'re\\n> talking about. When Bill [Gates] invested in Comcast cable, it\\n> triggered the Baby Bells to get on board with DSL. What are you doing\\n> now to deal with that issue?\\n\\nThe No. 1 thing is, we have to make software that is so compelling that\\npeople will start saying, \\'Well, of course I am going to get broadband.\\'\\n\\n> And 802.11 is one of those compelling features?\\n\\nYes, it is. I was in a hotel in Sun Valley, [Utah], this week that was\\nnot wired. So I turned on my PC, and XP tells me there is a wireless\\nnetwork available. So I connect to something called Mountaineer. Well, I\\ndon\\'t know what that is. But I have a VPN into Microsoft; it worked. I\\ndon\\'t know whose broadband I used. I didn\\'t see it in Bill\\'s room. I\\ncalled him up and said, \\'Hey, come over to my room.\\' So soon everyone is\\nthere and connecting to the Internet through my room.\\n\\nWe have to support all the modalities, whether it is GPRS [General\\nPacket Radio Service] or 802.11. We have to make it easy to provision\\nfrom a software perspective for things that go on with DSL [and] cable\\nmodems. ... And the software has to want a broadband link. There are not\\nmany things you do where you say I really care about the performance. If\\nI am downloading PowerPoint files, then I want broadband. So when you\\ncan do things with speed that you otherwise can\\'t do without speed, that\\nis going to put a lot of pressure on the broadband community.\\n\\nThat\\'s the weird answer. The more normal answer is, yeah, isn\\'t it\\nawful: There is not enough broadband, and the prices they charge ... . I\\nagree with all that. If you look at what happened in Japan recently,\\nthere was a big drop -- it is now $25 a month for DSL. Vroom. They have\\ngone from almost no DSL connections a year ago to 1.5 [million] or 1.8\\nmillion [subscribers].\\n\\n> So how do we make that happen in this country?\\n\\nI think that is beyond us. If there is enough interest where the\\nconsumers are looking intensely for broadband, whether it is at today\\'s\\nprices or tomorrow\\'s prices, that is going to shake out the\\nmarketplace. And I think the marketplace will do a good job. We just\\nhave to make it something obvious that consumers want. Now I happen to\\nlive in a neigborhood where there is no broadband network. No DSL or\\ncable modems. Well, I have a neighbor, [Teledesic chairman and co-CEO]\\nCraig McCaw, who has a wireless network that I think I can piggyback off\\nof [Ballmer laughs]. So, yes, broadband is a bottleneck -- but I also\\nthink we have to look at oursleves as a software industry and say,\\n\\'Aren\\'t we, too, some of that bottleneck?\\' We have not built software\\nthat makes broadband a must-have.\\n\\n> Microsoft CEO weighs in\\n> \\n> Ballmer addresses a number of key issues for customers and partners.\\n> \\n> On security and trust: \"There are some things I would have done\\n> differently.\"\\n> \\n> On coordinating product groups: \"We are working hard to make sure\\n> the whole is bigger than the sum of the parts.\"  \\n>\\n> On product licensing: \"We are still going to have to get smart\\n> about the full ramifications.\" \\n\\n\\n----\\naDaM@XeNT.CoM -- long .sig alert!\\n\\n\\n\\nI believe it is quite possible to productively apply both supposedly\\nincompatible approaches [REST & SOAP] together.  I\\'ll sketch it out\\nbelow, both in prescriptive form.  Note: while this is proscriptive, it\\nis expected that local adaptations will be provided.\\n\\n1. Start by modeling the persistent resources that you wish to expose.\\nBy persistent resources, I am referring to entities that have a typical\\nlife expectancy of days or greater.  Ensure that each instance has a\\nunique URL.  When possible, assign meaningful names to resources.\\n\\n2. Whenever possible, provide a default XML representation for each\\nrepresentation.  Unlike traditional object oriented programming\\nlanguages where there is a unique getter per property, typically there\\nwill be a single representation of the entire instance.  These\\nrepresentations will often contain XLinks (a.k.a. pointers or\\nreferences) to other instances.\\n\\n3. Now add high level methods which take care of all composite create,\\nupdate, and delete operations.  A key aspect of the design is that\\nmessages for these operations need to be self contained - both the\\nsender and receiver should be able to make the absolute minimum of\\nassumptions as to the other\\'s state, and multiple requests should not be\\nrequired to implement a single logical operation.  All requests should\\nprovide the appearance of being executed atomically.\\n\\n4. Query operations deserve special consideration.  A general purpose\\nXML syntax should be provided in every case.  In addition, when a\\nreasonable expectation exists that query parameters will be of a\\nrelatively short size and not require significant encoding, then a HTTP\\nGET with the parameters encoded as a query string should also be\\nprovided.\\n\\nImplications  \\n\\nThe following table emphasizes how this unified approach differs from\\nthe \"pure\" (albeit hypothetical) different positions described above.\\n\\n1. Resource -- POST operations explicitly have the possibility of\\nmodifying multiple resources.  PUT and DELETE operations are rarely\\nused, if ever.  GETs may contain query arguments.\\n\\n2. Get -- GETs must never be used for operations which observably change\\nthe state of the recipient.  POST should be used instead.\\n\\n3. Message -- Do not presume that URLs are static, instead presume that\\nthey identify the resource.  In particular, recognize that URLs can be\\ndynamically generated.  Expect URLs of other SOAP Resources in\\nresponses.  Use the SOAP Response MEP for pure retrieval operations.\\n\\n4. Procedure -- Treat the URL itself as the implicit first parameter.\\nAllow URLs to be dynamically generated, and returned in structures.  Use\\nHTTP GET for retrieval operations.\\n\\nConclusions  \\n\\nLooking to the future, the application level inter-networking protocols\\nthat emerge today will likely be the application level intra-networking\\nprotocols of the next decade.  Both REST and SOAP contain features that\\nthe others lack.  Most significantly:\\n\\nREST - SOAP = XLink\\n\\nThe key bit of functionality that SOAP applications miss today is the\\nability to link together resources.  SOAP 1.2 makes significant progress\\nin addressing this.  Hopefully WSDL 1.2 will complete this important work.\\n\\nSOAP - REST = Stored Procedures\\n\\nLooking at how other large scale systems cope with updates provides some\\nkey insights into productive areas for future research with respect to REST.\\n\\nFinally, it bears repeating.  Just because a service is using HTTP GET,\\ndoesn\\'t mean that it is REST.  If you are encoding parameters on the\\nURL, you are probably making an RPC request of a service, not retrieving\\nthe representation of a resource.  It is worth reading Roy Fielding\\'s\\n<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2002Apr/0181.html> thoughts\\non the subject.  The only exception to this rule that is routinely\\ncondoned within the REST crowd is queries.\\n\\n  -- Sam Ruby, http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/stories/2002/07/20/restSoap.html\\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\\n\\n\\n'},\n",

Pleas=\\r\\ne=20\\r\\ncheck my facts, I\\'d love to know if I\\'m wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of that reiserfs performance came from directories-as-hash-tables, whi=\\r\\nch=20\\r\\nI believe ext3/4 supports and is native for btrfs.  Some of that also came=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nfrom tail-packing, which could come from the extents feature of ext4 and=20\\r\\nshould be in btrfs.  The final edge reiserfs had was above-average=20\\r\\nflushing/caching algorithms, and the development pushes in ext4 and btrfs h=\\r\\nave=20\\r\\nlikely reduced or eliminated that; I think the unified block-device caching=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nsystem in the kernel able helped make that not such a big deal.\\r\\n\\r\\n> I\\'m a Reiser3 user myself, and I\\'ve never had any problems with it.\\r\\n>=20\\r\\n> (The trouble with it being \"long in the tooth\" is mostly hypothetical,\\r\\n> isn\\'t it?)\\r\\n\\r\\nNot really.  Reiserfs will probably be maintained in the kernel for a very=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nlong time, in that as any interfaces it uses are updated it will be updated=\\r\\n to=20\\r\\nuse the new interface.  However, ISTR there are open bugs on reiserfs that=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nwill not be fixed.  Similarly, I expect new bugs that can be blamed on the=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nreiserfs code are less likely to be fixed than bugs than can be blamed on t=\\r\\nhe=20\\r\\next2/3/4 or xfs code.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, as file system technology advances, reiserfs will become less=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nattractive for new installs and it will become more attractive to migrate a=\\r\\nway=20\\r\\nfrom it.  Unfortunately, migration tools are unlikely to be developed, outs=\\r\\nide=20\\r\\nof generic file system migration tools.  Compare with btrfs_convert which=20\\r\\nallows an ext2/3 file system to be converted to btrfs with no data copying;=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nsuch tools have to be aware of the internal structure of the file system an=\\r\\nd=20\\r\\nfewer and fewer developers will even HAVE that knowledge of reiserfs.  The=\\r\\n=20\\r\\nsource will be available, sure, but even kernel maintainers interested in f=\\r\\nile=20\\r\\nsystems are not interested in reiserfs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s no drop-dead date for reiserfs in the kernel (AFAIK), so there\\'s no=\\r\\n=20\\r\\npressing need to migrate away from it, but there is a lot of work on file=20\\r\\nsystems that should both perform better and be supported better than reiser=\\r\\nfs.\\r\\n=2D-=20\\r\\nBoyd Stephen Smith Jr.           \\t ,=3D ,-_-. =3D.\\r\\nbss@iguanasuicide.net            \\t((_/)o o(\\\\_))\\r\\nICQ: 514984 YM/AIM: DaTwinkDaddy \\t `-\\'(. .)`-\\'\\r\\nhttp://iguanasuicide.net/        \\t     \\\\_/\\r\\n'},\n",

Ordinarily, the machine is quite idle; it supports my\\nwife\\'s web site with Apache server running on it and a few other\\nservices (jabber, etc). Between the various members of our family, we\\nget a fair amount of email coming in (mailing lists, etc). On\\noccasion, our DSL-based ISP dies for a number of hours. When we get a\\nreconnection to the Internet, I get a huge flow of emails coming in\\nwhich are then filtered via razor. As a result, I will sometimes see\\nover 20+ sendmail processes running at the same time after such an\\noccasion. The machine is then REALLY slow.\\n\\nI noticed that my /etc/procmailrc file had had no arguments associated\\nwith the call to razor-check. There was something in the log, though,\\nto make me suspicious that it was possibly not seeing all my razor\\nfiles. So I have just added \"-home /etc/razor\" as an argument. I\\nhaven\\'t had any down time since then so I cannot comment on whether\\nthis change has sped up my razor processing a noticable amount. (This\\nparagraph may be an aside to my real problem, the first paragraph\\nabove; but I thought I should be complete in my description.)\\n\\nAt any rate, has anyone else suffered from a backlog of email\\nprocessing creating lots and lots of sendmail processes?  Is there,\\nperhaps, a way to limit the number of sendmail processes?\\n\\nAny ideas would be welcome.\\n\\nThanks,\\nJoe\\n---\\nJoe Berry\\njoe@topshot.com\\nAIM \"joe topshot\"\\nYahoo Msgr \"joetopshot\"\\njabber \"joetopshot@topshot.com\"\\nBaltimore, MD\\n\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old\\ncell phone?

I then clicked\\nthe \"Run It\"  button which opened the word processor OpenOffice Writer.\\nI then typed \"Linux is ready for the desktop and consumers can save\\nhundreds using LindowsOS.\" I selected \"Save as Microsoft Word.\"\\n\\nThe reporter was not only surprised, he was amazed. Like many reporters,\\nhe was under the impression that Linux was only for servers. The simple\\nword processor demonstration went a long way to show him otherwise. For\\nLinux to become a driving force in desktop computing it will have to\\novercome a couple of myths. \\n\\nThe first myth is that Linux is too hard to install and configure. That\\nmay have been true in the past, but we\\'ve annihilated this myth with the\\nlatest version of LindowsOS --which installs on most machines in under 5\\nminutes. It\\'s point- and-shoot easy - easier than any other operating\\nsystem (Microsoft products included). See for yourself at <http://www.tryoutlinux.com/> .  \\n\\nThe other myth is that Linux is just for the server and none of the\\ngraphical programs --which desktop users have come to rely on-- exist.\\nNot only have many of the Linux software programs made quantum leaps\\nover the last couple of years, but they\\'ve gotten quite good at reading\\nand writing Microsoft formats. The easiest way to experience these\\nproducts is via the Click-N-Run  <http://www.lindows.com/warehouse>\\nWarehouse.\\n\\n Here\\'s a quick list of some of the quality programs available today in\\nthe Warehouse <http://www.lindows.com/warehouse> all downloaded and\\ninstalled with a single click:\\n\\nOpenOffice - This one installation will equip a computer with an\\nimpressive collection of productivity programs each of which will open\\nthe corresponding Microsoft file format and allow you to edit files and\\nswap them with Microsoft counterparts. <www.lindows.com/openoffice>\\nPrograms included are:\\n\\nOpenOffice Writer - Word processor (reads Microsoft Word docs) \\nOpenOffice Calc - Spreadsheet (reads Microsoft Excel) \\nOpenOffice Impress- Presentation package (reads Microsoft PowerPoint)\\nOpenOffice Draw - A vector based drawing program\\n\\nClick here <http://www.lindows.com/openofficeflash>  for a great\\ntutorial on getting to know OpenOffice.\\n\\nGIMP <www.lindows.com/gimp> If you are familiar with Adobe\\'s Photoshop,\\nyou\\'ll want to Click-N-Run GIMP.

See how easy it for yourself, visit\\nFlowchart Pro at <http://www.lindows.com/flowchartpro>\\n\\nThis is just a handful of the quality programs available in the\\nWarehouse <www.lindows.com/warehouse> that make Linux a practical choice\\nfor the desktop today. And if you\\'re still not convinced, then do the\\nmath.\\n\\n<http://www.lindows.com/walmart> \\nFor  a total cost of $499 <http://www.lindows.com/walmart> , including\\nall  software, computer users save  more than $800  for a complete\\nsystem. \\n\\nWith such major price differentials between the two similarly equipped\\nsystems, any business, school or home will find their computing dollars\\nstretched much further running LindowsOS. \\n\\nMichael Robertson\\n\\nPlease visit <http://support.lindows.com/>  to\\nanswers questions you may have about LindowsOS or Lindows.com.\\n\\nBringing Choice to Your Computer! \\n\\nLindowsOS is presently available on LindowsOS Certified Computers being\\noffered from Lindows.com  <http://www.lindows.com/builder> Builder\\npartners.

       "  'payload': 'from http://www.arstechnica.com/\\n\\n\"There has mostly been talk thus far and little action, but the Department\\nof Justice says it may be ready to file criminal lawsuits against\\nindividuals [1] who distribute or receive unauthorized copyrighted\\nmaterial over the Internet. Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Malcolm believes\\nthat \"criminal prosecutions of copyright offenders are now necessary to\\npreserve the viability of America\\'s content industries.\" Malcolm also\\nbelieves that people who trade copyrighted material think they are\\nparticipating in a legal activity. I certainly think people who download\\ncopyrighted works understand that such distribution--barring provisions\\nsuch as fair use--is not authorized, and it is not surprising to see\\nbusinesses continue to look for means to discourage distribution of\\ncopyrighted works.\\n\\n\\n\"Some prosecutions that make that clear could be very helpful...I think\\nthey would think twice if they thought there was a risk of criminal\\nprosecution,\" said [RIAA President Cary] Sherman, who was on the same\\nconference panel.\\n\\nI\\'m not too confident that lawsuits would have the effect Sherman is\\nhoping for. Although infrequent, there have already been civil suits or\\nwarnings issued to private individuals, and they have served as minor\\ndeterrents to the file-sharing community at large. Criminal lawsuits\\ncarrying with them the possibility of prison sentences may generate\\nfurther animosity against groups such as the RIAA and may be difficult to\\ninitiate because of the \"schooling\" effect of millions of systems\\nparticipating in file sharing. Only servers would seem to stand out from\\nthe crowd.\\n\\nThe article cites the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act [2], which defines\\nillegal  activity and maximum penalties for copyright infringement:\\n\\n\\nCriminal infringement: Any person who infringes a copyright willfully for\\npurposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain, or by the\\nreproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any\\n180-day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more\\ncopyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000....\\nFor purposes of this subsection, evidence of reproduction or distribution\\nof a copyrighted work, by itself, shall not be sufficient to establish\\nwillful infringement.\\n...\\nThe term \"financial gain\" includes receipt, or expectation of receipt, of\\nanything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works.\\n\\n\\nTherefore, receipt of a work of value would be defined as \"financial gain\"\\neven if no money is involved. The NET Act excerpt does not clarify how the\\nvalue of a work is determined; an album or movie could be worth only $15\\nto millions of dollars depending on whether the value is assessed from the\\nperspective of the consumer or copyright holder.\\n\\nThe statute of limitations:\\n\\n\\n507. Limitations on actions\\n\\n(a) Criminal Proceedings.--No criminal proceeding shall be maintained\\nunder the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within five\\nyears after the cause of action arose.\\n\\n(b) Civil Actions.--No civil action shall be maintained under the\\nprovisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after\\nthe claim accrued.\\n\\nThe penalties are too extensive to list here, but they can be found in\\nSection 2319: Criminal infringement of a copyright. In general, first-time\\ncriminal offenses will carry a maximum prison sentence of 1 year.\\n\\nI\\'m still not sure where the DOJ would start in choosing people to\\nprosecute because of the aforementioned \"schooling\" effect, but my guess\\nwould be that, just like speeding, primarily the most prominent\\nindividuals who operate large servers or transfer the most data will be\\ntargeted in order to discourage more recreational file sharers. Thanks to\\nMonaLisaOverdrive for pointing out this story.\\n\"\\n\\n[1] http://news.com.com/2100-1023-954591.html?tag=fd_top\\n[2] http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/17-18red.htm\\n\\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\\n\\n'},\n",

If they can\\'t figure out how to make\\nmoney doing something, they\\'ll actually burn money to make sure no\\n\"industry outsider\" can either for all intents and purposes; control is\\nmore important than maximizing profit as long as they can make a\\nprofit.  They don\\'t need your carrot, so they only engage in reasonable\\nbusiness behavior when you are carrying a very large stick, and few\\npeople swing a stick large enough.  They are being chronically\\n\"investigated\" by the DoJ for anti-trust, collusion, and similar\\nactivities, but that is mostly just for show.\\n\\nWhich isn\\'t to say that the entertainment industry won\\'t fall victim to\\nits own stupidity, but their ability to do arbitrary and capricious\\nprice manipulation with impunity is going to make it a slow decline.\\n\\n-James Rogers\\n jamesr@best.com\\n\\n\\n\\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'payload': 'On The Way to Telluride, On My Way Back to the World\\n\\n8/29/02\\n\\nDear friends,\\n\\nI go to turn my computer on but I have forgotten where the on/off switch\\nis. I have had this laptop for three years, but I haven\\'t turned it on for\\nthe past two months. I look on its left side, I feel around the back, I\\nfind it on the right and I feel like an idiot. The screen reads \"fatal\\nerror\" and offers to \"save\" whatever I had typed on it last June 21st, a\\nfew weeks before my mother died. I hit CTL.ALT.DEL. and it is gone. Gone.\\nGone like this long, sad, summer, frozen now, and nothing seemingly matters\\nbut everything matters more now than ever before. Why did she have to die?\\nWhen will this pain stop? \\n\\nI got up this morning to fly out to Colorado. The Telluride Film Festival\\nis screening my film tomorrow night, the first time it will be shown in the\\nUnited States. My mother did not get to see this new film. She was always\\nso proud of everything I did, cheering me on every day from the day where\\nmy memory begins. I had shown an early cut of the film to my friends last\\nwinter in my parent\\'s living room, and mom would come in and out of the\\nroom, catching a scene here and there, saying, \"Boy, that\\'s something,\\nisn\\'t it!\" \\n\\nI don\\'t feel right, right now. I have avoided most people for the past two\\nmonths. I can\\'t conceive in my mind having to face a crowd of strangers, no\\nmatter how supportive or appreciative they may be. Everyone says to me it\\nwill be good to get back to work, good to be busy, take my mind off my\\nsadness, as if not aware that what I really might need is for it to be the\\nother way around. At my family\\'s insistence, I tried going on TV a few\\nweeks ago to talk about the corporate crooks roaming our great land. I had\\ndecided to give it a try, and gave it my best shot, and ended up feeling so\\nempty and more alone. I had agreed to go on \"Crossfire\" and Donahue (thank\\nGod for this guy!) on the condition that I would not have to have one of\\nthose stupid cable news shouting matches with three rightwingnuts where no\\none can hear (or wants to hear) what\\'s being said. \\n\\nThey agreed to the terms, but as Bob Novak asked his first question about\\naren\\'t my true motives to destroy capitalism and make America a socialist\\ncountry, I just sat there for a moment and didn\\'t respond. I thought I\\nwould just take the microphone off and leave - who needs these f-----s! -\\nbut then, my dad was with me in the studio and I looked over at him and\\nsmiled, and then into the camera I said, yes, Bob, that is exactly what I\\nintend to do and, considering more people have bought my book than any\\nother nonfiction book in America this year, I guess that means that the\\nmajority of Americans agree with me on this point, so look out Bob \\'cause\\nwe\\'re going to seize your money first! I asked the studio audience in DC\\nfor a show of hands of all those who agreed and I was later told that\\nnumerous hands shot up in the air, much to the chagrin of a stunned Bob\\nNovak. I also added that I thought the Pope was onto something when he said\\nthat capitalism is a \"sin.\"\\n\\nMy dad liked that. He is a sweet, strong, smart man and I loved the drive\\nwith him back home. We took a spin through the Michigan State campus and he\\ntold me how he had come down here after World War II to inquire about going\\nto college but thought it best to return to the assembly line where he had\\na secure job. His years during the war serving in the Marines were going to\\nbe counted toward his seniority. And so he worked the spark plug and oil\\nfilter assembly line for 33 years and provided for mom and us kids and gave\\nus all his love -- which, of course, mattered the most. \\n\\n                      *        *       *       *       *        *\\n\\nDad took me to the airport this morning, remarking on the way how much mom\\nwould have enjoyed this simple trip across town to Bishop Airport, how\\nhappy she would have been knowing that I was heading off on a new journey\\nin my very fortunate life. I thought about how she came to New York for the\\nscreening of \"Roger & Me\" at the New York Film Festival in 1989, and how I\\ngot to introduce her and my aunt as they sat in the front of the balcony,\\nand how mom and Aunt Lois stood and took a long Lincoln Center bow, and how\\nI stood on that stage and felt that she deserved every bit of that applause\\nand more. \\n\\nIt\\'s a bittersweet memory now, as I\\'ve just found out that the NYFF\\nselection committee this year is too afraid to show my new film.\\n\"Politics,\" is what I have been told. Too \"populist\" for the new elite who\\nnow sit in judgment of what is art. \"They don\\'t want to help further your\\nplatform Mike,\" a person close to the committee tells me. \"One of them even\\nsaid, \\'I know this film is going to be popular - and I don\\'t personally\\nwant to contribute to its popularity.\\'\"  So, it was decided that \"Bowling\\nfor Columbine,\" a Cannes prize-winner, knighted by the Chicago Tribune as\\n\"one of the most effective political/polemical films ever,\" a film chosen\\nby every single film festival around the world this fall - no, this film\\nmust not be shown at Lincoln Center just six blocks from the edit room\\nwhere we made it... 77 blocks north of ground zero. I\\'ve gone too far this\\ntime, cut too close to the bone, stuck my lens where it doesn\\'t belong -\\nright straight through the heart of an America that is both master and\\nvictim of the ultra-violence. It is so sad to see this place where I will\\nalways remember my mother taking that bow now cowering to the whims of neos\\nwho, like their counterparts in Hollywood, preside over the demolition of a\\nonce great art form.\\n\\n                     *      *      *      *      *      *      *\\n\\nMy dad drops me off and goes to park in the short-term lot. He comes inside\\njust as the airport personnel are taking everything out of my suitcase for\\ninspection. They don\\'t ask to see the print of the film, the only thing I\\nmight have had on me that is poised to do any real damage (to all the right\\npeople, of course). My dad and I stop short of the metal detectors and the\\nnext round of inspectors who are anxious to look at my smelly feet. We hug,\\nand he kisses me, and I am trying hard, so very hard, to not break down in\\nthe middle of this airport. He tells me not to worry about him, and I tell\\nhim I\\'ll call him from Detroit when I am changing planes. I go through\\nsecurity and as I am being taken aside to be searched again, I look back\\nand see him still standing there, watching out for me. My dad.\\n\\nI\\'m on the plane and I\\'m thirsty, but I took the water bottle out of my bag\\nwhen I packed it this morning. The bottle, half-drank, had been sitting\\nuntouched in my untouched bag since I stuck it in there the night we had to\\nrush my mom to the hospital. The bottle was still there in that overnight\\nbag where I put my t-shirt and sweatpants, the ones I had on for the night\\nand day I sat by my mother\\'s side in the hospital as she struggled to live,\\nholding her hand, holding her head, trying to comfort her, strands of hair\\non my sweater. I can see the stains from where my tears and mucus ran\\nuncontrollably down my face and onto that sweater. The doctor said she had\\nan 80% chance of making it. An hour before she died, another doctor said\\nthe chances were 1 in 100. That was good enough for me. One in one hundred!\\nI\\'ve had those odds! I won! Don\\'t let her die! Please do everything you can\\ndo! Don\\'t let her die.\\n\\nThe priest came, then another priest came, and when the priests left my dad\\nasked us three kids and the three grandkids to all join hands and say our\\ngoodbyes to mom, say whatever we wanted to about what she meant to us. (I\\nam sorry... I cannot complete this paragraph right now, I can\\'t see the\\nscreen through the tears...maybe someday...)\\n\\nThe night before we rushed her to the hospital I had a little surprise\\nplanned for her. I had brought a copy of my new movie and I was going to\\nshow it to her. As the end credits would roll, she would get to see what\\nshe has seen at the end of all of my work: her name along with my dad\\'s in\\nthat list of credits...and, to me, it\\'s the only real credit that ever\\nmattered -- because without them I would not have the life they gave me,\\nthe way they raised me... it is all a privilege I will never cease being\\nthankful for.\\n\\nI never got to show her the movie that night. \"Mike!\" she called out from\\nthe porch, in a pitch of voice I had never heard. \"Get your father! I don\\'t\\nfeel good.\" She was, without warning, dying. Within 48 hours she would be\\ngone.\\n\\n                 *          *          *          *          *          *\\n\\nI\\'m walking through the Detroit airport to gate 75 for the flight to\\nDenver, and I hear someone say, \"OK, Mr. Stuckup, just walk right on by!\" I\\nturn to see it is one of anchors from the local TV station in Flint. I\\napologize. My sunglasses are on. I have been crying since I left my dad at\\nthe Flint airport. I explain this to her and she starts to get tears in her\\neyes. \"My mom died in October,\" she says, and I realize that this pain that\\nfeels so solitary is, truthfully, a shared experience amongst us all. No\\none is immune from this loss. But instead of taking the time to tell me\\nabout how rough it has been for HER, she asks about how I am doing and how\\nis my dad doing and did we get the flowers she and the others sent. She\\ngives me her number and says to call anytime if I feel the need to talk. At\\nthat moment I remember what she told me -- that her mother also died this\\nyear-- and I think, man, get over yourself, Mike, you are not alone in\\nthis, and so I ask her how she is doing. \"I think a lot,\" she says, \"about\\nall the things she won\\'t see my two children grow up to do, to be. But I\\nbelieve she is in my heart, right here, right now, and she will see it\\nall.\"\\n\\nThey call my flight and I rush over to the payphone to call my dad to see\\nif he got home OK. He tells me that when he left the short- term lot he got\\ntalking to the person in the tollbooth who told him about her mother\\ngetting cancer and how she was caring for her. \"She said that her bill in\\nthe hospital came to $60,000,\" he says with astonishment. \"They won\\'t be\\nable to pay it. She makes six dollars an hour, no health insurance. I gave\\nher a tip along with the toll.\"\\n\\n\"You gave the tollbooth worker a tip?\"\\n\\n\"Well, you have to. That person could be you or me.\"\\n\\nThat is my father. That was my mother. \\n\\nYours, \\n\\nMichael Moore\\nmike@michaelmoore.com\\nhttp://www.michaelmoore.com\\n\\nPS. Thank you, all of you, who sent me your condolences and who contributed\\nto the local poverty program in my mother\\'s name. I was so moved by your\\ngenerosity and by your words of love and kindness.

We have been following t=\\r\\nhe cosmetics and beauty industry now for quite some time. According to Fo=\\r\\nrbes.com who did an article on the growth of the cosmetics industry, beau=\\r\\nty products generate nearly 230 billion annually in global sales, with a =\\r\\nconsumer preference placed on products that are high tech and natural bas=\\r\\ned (favoring companies like EUOK). With the current status of the company=\\r\\n, EUOK is poised to grab no less than 1% of global sales, ensuring 230 mi=\\r\\nllion in gross sales for EUOK. Based off revenue alone that would warrant=\\r\\n a $6.57 share price.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  The financials speak for themselves; EUOK is set to make a run and is e=\\r\\nxtremely undervalued.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  In the past, large multinational corporations have dominated the market=\\r\\n place, but in recent years boutique brands such as EUOK have been at the=\\r\\n fore front of consumer spending. EUOK is ready to take full advantage of=\\r\\n this. Data released from the NPD Group (a marketing info company based i=\\r\\nn New York) says luxury cosmetics have grown at an annual rate of 4% - 7%=\\r\\n since 2002. Estee lauder and L=E2=80=99Oreal have realized this and have=\\r\\n been acquiring companies like EUOK in order to meet the demand of consum=\\r\\ners.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  There are several reasons behind the growth in high-end cosmetics: the =\\r\\nexpansion of new markets in Russia and Asia; changing social norms that m=\\r\\nake using cosmetics--not to mention undergoing cosmetic surgery--more acc=\\r\\neptable; celebrity worship; promotion within fashion magazines; improveme=\\r\\nnts in the technology that creates makeup; the influence of mass retailer=\\r\\ns that can offer lower prices, and raising affluence. As cosmetics become=\\r\\ns less expensive, better and more accessible, more affluent women--and in=\\r\\ncreasingly men as well--have moved away from older brands of makeup and s=\\r\\nkincare in search of higher-quality new products and more exclusivity. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  EUOK recognizes this and has gained retail distribution worldwide throu=\\r\\ngh its relationships with department store retail giants such as Barneys =\\r\\nNew York, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus, Bliss, Harr=\\r\\nods (London), Printemps (France), La Rinascente (Italy) and Lane Crawford=\\r\\n (Hong Kong).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Upper management of EUOK has a three prong approach to further drive gl=\\r\\nobal brand recognition:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  North America \\r\\n\\r\\n  EUOK strategy in North America is one of strong luxury brand positionin=\\r\\ng through partnerships with premier department stores and flagship locati=\\r\\nons. EUOK department store partners include Bergdorf Goodman in New York =\\r\\nCity, Barneys New York nationwide, Ogilvy, as well as boutique-style depa=\\r\\nrtment stores across USA and Canada. EUOK also operates brand-owned flags=\\r\\nhip stores in Toronto and Vancouver. EUOK subsidiary, Hewitt-Vevey, is po=\\r\\nsitioned in medical facilities and online, with p\\r\\nlans to grow in both directions. Future expansion plans include creating =\\r\\nnew partnerships with other major department stores, as well as positioni=\\r\\nng with 5-star hotels in key markets. \\r\\n\\r\\n   \\r\\n\\r\\n  Europe \\r\\n\\r\\n  EUOK distribution in Europe varies by market but is restricted to luxur=\\r\\ny channels that position the brand amongst the leading luxury skincare br=\\r\\nands. Our representation includes department stores and perfumeries in ma=\\r\\njor markets. These channels include Printemps in France, Harrods and Libe=\\r\\nrty in the UK, La Rinascente in Italy, as well as perfumeries in other co=\\r\\nuntries. Expansion plans for Europe are focused primarily in the UK and F=\\r\\nrance with negotiations with premier department stores under way. \\r\\n\\r\\n   \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Asia \\r\\n\\r\\n  EUOK distribution in Asia varies by country for best positioning amongs=\\r\\nt the leading luxury brands. Our major department store partner in Hong K=\\r\\nong is Lane Crawford, as well as Joyce. We are also represented through l=\\r\\nuxury perfumeries and spas in Singapore and South Eastern China. Asia rep=\\r\\nresents our largest immediate growth potential.

       "  'payload': \"Gooday,\\n\\nWith warm heart my friend, I send you my greetings, and I hope this letter meets you in good time. \\n\\nIt will be surprising  to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally. However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a person of intergrity. I have kept it to myself for a long time, and now I need to act, as time is not on my side. I want you to open-heartedly read through and give me your most needed support. I got your address from an internet directory, in my search for a contact. I apologize if this is not acceptable to you. The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance. \\n\\nMy name is Donald Phiri, the farm supervisor and personal assistant to Mr. David Stevens, a very popular and rich farmer from Macheke, Zimbabwe. My master was murdered in cold blood in my presence on 15 of April 2001, due to the land dispute and political situation in my country, as a result of my master's financial support for the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change), the main opposition party to President Mugabe's party,  Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) . For more information on my master's murder, you may check the Amnesty International Country Report on Zimbabwe for the year 2001.\\n\\nWhen the pressure on white farmers started in Zimbabwe due to the support given to the war veterans by President Mugabe to invade farms and force out white farmers, my master forsaw the danger ahead, he then closed his major bank accounts, and together, we went to Johannesburg, South Africa to deposit the sum of $14.5 million (Fourten million, five hundred thousand USdollars), in a private security company, for safety. This money was deposited in a box in my name, as my master was being secretive with his name, as the South African government of Thambo Mbeki is in support of President Mugabe's actions. The box is labeled as gemstones. My master had planned to use this money  for the purchase of lands, new machines and chemicals for establishment of new farms in Botswana. He has used this company in the past to move money for the purchase of tractors and farm equipment from Europe. My master is divorced, and his wife Valerie, and only child, Diana have relocated to Bradford, !\\n En!\\ngland for 9years now. \\n\\nI am currently in the Netherlands where I am seeking political asylum. I have now decided to transfer my  master's  money into an account for security and safety reasons. This is why I am anxiously and humbly seeking for your genuine assistance in transfering this money into an account without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything my master left. You have to understand that this decision taken by me entrusts so much to you.\\n\\nIf you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the box containing the money from their office here in the Netherlands, and then we will transfer the money into an account. You may open a new account for this purpose. I have applied to the security company to transfer the box from South Africa to their branch here, which they have done. \\n\\nTo legally process the claim of the box, I will contact a lawyer to help me prepare a change of ownership and letter of authority to enable them recognise you as my representative, and deliver the box to you. I have with me, the certificate used to deposit the box, which we will need for claiming the box. \\n\\nFor valuable assistance, I am offering you 10%($1,450,000) of the total money. I have also set aside 1%($145,000) of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%($580,000), will be given to Charity in my master's name I will give 25% ($3,625,000) to Valerie and Diana, after my share of the money has been transfered back to me. When they grant my asylum application, my share of the money (85%), will be transfered back to me, into an account I will solely own. I also intend to start up a business then. If you have knowledge of farming business in your country, or other areas of possible business investment that I may be interested in, please inform me, so that my some of my share of the money can be invested for the time being.\\n\\nPlease, I want to you maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction due to my safety and successful conclusion of the transaction. \\n\\nI look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I am sure it will be nice to extend ties with you.\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\nDonald Phiri. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n--DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam--\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\\nWelcome to geek heaven.\\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\\n_______________________________________________\\nSpamassassin-Sightings mailing list\\nSpamassassin-Sightings@lists.sourceforge.net\\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-sightings\\n\\n\\n\"},\n",

Ed\\nCrane (Billy Bob Thornton) is the archetype everyman. A barber by trade,\\nCrane represents the individual in society. He hears everything, but\\ntruly knows nothing. Everything he hears is modified ever so slightly by\\nthe retelling. He gets neither the whole story nor the true motivations.\\nLeft to guess at the motivations and desires of those around him, Crane\\ndevelops an indifference to it all. When a snake oil sales man slithers\\ninto town, Crane takes this opportunity to cheat the cheaters and punish\\nthe punishers.  As indifferent as Crane appears, he is no match for the\\namorality of fate. As much as fate is indifferent in its wrath, however,\\nso is it artistic in its execution. That is what makes our lives so\\nentertaining. Fate doles ultimate justice, but never as expected. The\\nMan Who Wasn\\'t There is truly a Kafkaesque tale of an individual\\'s year\\nto turn against the tide of inevitability. Atypical of cuter, more\\nrecent Coen brothers fare, this film is reminiscent of their earlier\\nnoir works like Blood Simple and Miller\\'s Crossing. Frances McDormand\\ndoes an outstanding job making as Crane\\'s selfish wife and James\\nGandolfini exudes boorishness as Doris\\' boss. The real outstanding\\nperformances, however, rest with the supporting cast. Tony Shalhoub, as\\npompus attorney Freddy Riedenschneider and  Jon Polito as the snake oil\\nsalesman impress and entertain as cruel, but offbeat parodies of their\\ncharacters.

My\\r\\n74-year-old mother in law uses Kubuntu.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo if the Debian support is so great, why do I run Ubuntu and not\\r\\nDebian? Several reasons. One, the low barrier to entry means that I\\r\\ncan get a system up and running in no time flat. Twice a year, 20\\r\\nminutes and I\\'ve got the latest and greatest software versions. Debian\\r\\nstill needs tweaking for my problematic video card, and some other\\r\\nreally small details. But the biggest reason that I run Ubuntu is to\\r\\npromote it.

Some would say\\nI am out of luck, but as long as the program uses Windows\\nInstaller, then I am on Cloud Nine. Why am I so happy? Because for\\nany program that uses Windows Installer, I can turn on logging\\nthrough the Registry. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \\\\ Software \\\\\\nPolicies \\\\ Microsoft \\\\ Windows \\\\ Installer. Add a new String\\nvalue, double-click it, and enter the following Value data:\\n\"voicewarmup\" (sans quotes).

If you\\nadd a plus, the existing file will be appended. If you add an\\nexclamation mark, each line is flushed. Now, when something fails,\\nI just have to check in the \"Temp\" directory and look for my log\\nfiles. They\\'ll vary in name, but will always start with \"Msi\" and\\nend with the .LOG extension.

The developers of Gaim, an instant messenger client\\nthat combines several different networks, found a vulnerability in the\\nhyperlink handling code. The 'Manual' browser command passes an\\nuntrusted string to the shell without escaping or reliable quoting,\\npermitting an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the users\\nmachine. Unfortunately, Gaim doesn't display the hyperlink before the\\nuser clicks on it. Users who use other inbuilt browser commands aren't\\nvulnerable.\\n\\nThe fixed version of Gaim no longer passes the user's manual browser\\ncommand to the shell.

You will learn new\\nskills in communications and how to market on the internet.\\nWhat a Deal!  Your total cash investment is just $50.00.\\n\\nStep 1.  If this is the first time you have seen this message,\\nand you have not joined in this program before, then\\ntake out five US$10.00 bills (total $50 investment), and mail\\nout $10.00 each to the following people to purchase five\\nGuides on communications.  For each Guide that you will\\nbe ordering and buying, write out on a sheet of plain white\\npaper, your own name, address, and YOUR OWN EMAIL\\nADDRESS, and the number and name of the Guide that\\nyou are buying.  Then fold the paper, put the $10.00 bill\\ninside the sheet of paper, insert the paper and $10.00 bill\\ninto an envelope, address the envelope with the name and\\naddress of the person whose name is shown under each\\nGuide below, and mail the envelope by first class or air\\nmail. Be sure to put enough postage stamps on the\\nenvelopes.  No need to send by registered mail.\\n\\nLIST OF FIVE NAMES****************************\\n________________________________________________\\n\\nGUIDE# 1: \"How to be A More Effective Public Speaker\"\\nOrder Guide #1 for US$10.00 CASH from: (In addition to\\nGuide #1, you will receive a valuable marketing Guide\\n\"A Million Bucks From the Internet\", free of charge)\\n\\nDerrick Nguyen\\t\\n9530 Whitmore St\\t\\nEl Monte, CA 91733\\t\\nUSA\\n________________________________________________\\n\\nGUIDE # 2: \"How to Give a Business Presentation\"\\nOrder Guide # 2 for US$10.00 CASH from:\\n\\nTim Fai\\nGPO Box 260\\nMacau (via Hong Kong)\\n________________________________________________\\n\\nGUIDE# 3: \"How to Write More Effectively\"\\nOrder Guide # 3 for US$10.00 CASH from:\\n\\nLuis Pastor\\nApartado 81\\n48080 Bilbao\\nSpain\\n________________________________________________\\n\\nGUIDE # 4: \"What to do at a Social Function\"\\nOrder Guide # 4 for US$10.00 CASH from:\\n\\nChester Waldvogel\\n11 Chestnut Way\\nBerlin, MD 21811\\nUSA\\n________________________________________________\\n\\nGUIDE # 5: \"How To Sharpen Your Mind\"\\nOrder Guide # 5 for US$10.00 CASH from:\\n\\nJ. Siden\\nKrondikesvagen 54 A\\n83147 Ostersund\\nSweden\\n________________________________________________\\nEND OF LIST OF FIVE NAMES*********************\\n\\nStep 2.  These Guides will be emailed to you.  Save these\\nGuides on your computer\\'s hard disk as other people will be\\nordering these Guides from you, paying you for them and\\nyou will need to email the Guides to the new buyers.\\n\\nStep 3.  From the list of names above, delete the name and\\naddress of the person shown under GUIDE#5, and replace that\\nslot with the name and address of the person from GUIDE #4\\'s\\nslot.  Be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown.\\nCheck the address again.\\n\\nStep 4.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #4, and\\nreplace with the name and address from GUIDE #3\\'s slot.\\n\\nStep 5.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #3, and\\nreplace with the name and address from  GUIDE#2\\'s slot.\\n\\nStep 6.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #2, and\\nreplace with the name and address from GUIDE #1\\'s slot.\\n\\nStep 7.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #1, and\\nreplace with YOUR OWN NAME AND ADDRESS. This\\nstep is how your own name and address is entered into the\\nlist of names to receive orders for the Guides. Eventually,\\nyour own name will go down the list of names until you have\\nreached GUIDE #5, and then be dropped from the list. The\\nkey point is that the number of people ordering Guides from\\nyou will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes.\\n\\nStep 8.  Once you have completed this new list, send out\\nthis new email (which shows your name under GUIDE #1) to\\nas many email addresses as possible, as many as 100,000\\nemails or even more.  The greater the number of mailings\\nyou make, potentially the greater the number of people who\\nwill order the GUIDE #1 from you.  These people will then\\nmake new emails to send out to their addresses with the email\\nshowing your name under GUIDE #2, and so on.\\n\\nThis is all you need to do.  If you wish to read the rest of\\nthis email message, then do so.  If not, just do the 8 steps\\nshown above. Remember, the key point is to send out as\\nmany emails as possible in step 8, and to encourage and help\\nthose who purchase the Guides from you to send out\\nemails of their own.\\n\\nDo NOT change anything other than what is instructed.\\nBecause if you do, it will not work for you.  Your immediate\\nreaction might be: Why not replace all the names on the list\\nwith the names of your spouse, kids, relatives, and friends.\\nThat might seem to you like a clever move because new\\nbuyers will be sending their money to these people.  But\\nthat move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit.\\nWhat will benefit you most is having people who will send\\nout emails, seek new buyers, and provide assistance to new\\nbuyers. If the people you slip into that list aren\\'t going to\\nbe sending new emails, you\\'re only hurting yourself by\\neffectively closing down the program with your name on\\ntop of the list of the names that you have inserted.  There\\nwouldn\\'t be new buyers coming in. So, your sly maneuver\\nwill gain you exactly zero!  Furthermore, if you have done\\nthe work, and your name has worked its way to further\\ndown the list, by then you deserve the rewards and\\nearnings from that effort, and it would be unethical for\\nanyone to remove your name for whatever reason.  Don\\'t\\ndo it to others. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!\\n\\nYou may have a concern that after sending the total $50 to\\nthe five people on the list that one of the people will just\\ntake your money, and not send you the Guide.  Well, rest\\nassured.  As we said above, it\\'s to our benefit to have you\\nas a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to find\\nnew buyers.  So don\\'t think the people on the list will try to\\ncheat you or to \"stiff\" you for $10.00.  The people on the list\\nwould rather have you working hard because your effort will\\nbenefit them as well as you.  Later on, when other buyers send\\nyou the order to buy the Guides, fulfill your end of the deal\\nby sending the ordered Guide to the buyer.  Don\\'t cheat.\\nProvide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit.\\n******END OF SUMMARY************************\\n\\n=======REST OF MESSAGE======================\\n\\nWith easy-to-use email tools and opt-in email, success in\\nthis business is now well within the capabilities of ordinary\\npeople who may not have done any internet marketing before.\\nAnd the earnings potential is staggering!\\n\\nREAD THIS EMAIL TO THE END! -\\nfollow what it says  - and you will not worry whether a\\nRECESSION is coming or not, or whether or not you can\\nafford to buy that new car or home that you have been\\nlooking for.  Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never\\nresponded to one of these before either. One day though,\\nsomething made me feel: \"You use $50 going to a movie\\nfor 2 hours with your spouse, friend, or child, plus a simple\\nmeat at a restaurant.  Why the heck not?\"  No matter where\\nyou believe those \"feelings\" came from, I thank every day\\nthat feeling came over me.\\n\\nI cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing\\nhad I not. Read on. It works.  And when you read the Guides,\\nYou\\x92ll learn how to become a more effective communicator.\\nWhat can be better?  A way to improve your self-image and\\nconfidence and at the same time have the potential to recover\\nyour investment and make some good money: making over\\nhalf a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home.\\nIf you work on this program, you will learn a lot about direct\\nmarketing on the internet.  If you believe direct marketing\\nvia the internet is the way sales and marketing will be done\\nin the future, then the experience you will gain here could\\nbe a real boost in your work career, possibly even providing\\na new career for you.\\n\\n= PRINT THIS MESSAGE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE =\\n\\nIf you want to make serious money, read this message until\\nyou understand it completely and feel confident to follow\\nthrough on what it advises.\\n\\nFOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION ABOVE AND\\nYOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS CAN COME TRUE!\\n\\nRemember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it,\\nit will NOT work!  This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You\\nare offering a product for sale to a buyer. Treat it as such\\nand you can see money coming to you  in a reasonable period\\nof time, depending on the collective efforts of yourself and\\nthe others on the list of five.\\n\\n===========================================\\n*** Take this entire email, with the modified list of names,\\nand save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER\\nCHANGES.  There are 2 methods to get this venture going:\\n\\nMETHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK EMAIL LEGALLY\\n===========================================\\n\\nLet\\'s say that you start small, to see how it goes, and that\\nyou and those involved send out only 5,000 emails each.\\nLet\\'s also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.1%\\n(1/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better\\nbut let\\'s just say it is only 0.1%). Also many people will\\nsend out hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only\\n5,000 each.\\n\\nOut of your 5,000 emails and a 0.1% response, that is only\\n5 orders for Guide # 1. Those 5 people who responded also\\nsend out 5,000 emails each for a total of 25,000. Out of\\nthose 25,000 emails only 0.1% responded with orders.\\nThat\\'s 25 people who responded and ordered Guide # 2.\\n\\nThose 25 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of\\n125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is 125 orders\\nfor Guide # 3. Those 125 people send 5,000 emails each\\nfor a total of 625,000 emails sent out. The 0.1% response\\nis 625 orders for Guide # 4.\\n\\nThose 625 people send out 5,000 emails each for a total\\nof 3,125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is  3,125\\norders for Guide # 5, or $31,250 at $10 per Guide.  This\\nmay seem a small amount to you, but remember we used a\\nvery low response rate with a small number of emails being\\nsent out.  See what happens if you can get the response rate\\nup just slightly.\\n\\nIf Response Rate is 0.1%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:\\n$50+250+1,250+6,250+31,250 = $39,050 (as above)\\n\\nIf Response Rate is 0.15%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:\\n$75+560+4,220+31,640+237,300 = $273,795\\n\\nIf Response Rate is 0.2%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:\\n$100+1,000+10,000+100,000+1,000,000 = $1,111,100\\n\\nDare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone\\nor half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000\\nemails each or more?  From the example above, you can see\\nthe power of leveraging, that is, how much greater is the\\namount of money from a small increase in the response rate.\\n\\nThere are over 200 million people on the internet worldwide\\nand counting, with thousands more coming online every day.\\n\\nMETHOD # 2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\\n===========================================\\n\\nAdvertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are\\nMany FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on\\nthe internet will get a response. We strongly suggest you start\\nwith  Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along.\\nFor every $10 you receive, all you must do is email the\\nGuide the buyer ordered. Always provide same day service.\\n\\nThe people you buy these Guides from will assist and advise\\nyou how to get the large number of email addresses that\\nyou need to send the new email containing your name and\\naddress.  In return, when others buy the Guides from you,\\nyou also should help those buyers to resell the Guides to\\ntheir email addresses.  This will benefit you because your\\nname would be further down the list, and their new buyers\\nwill buy from you.  This is no different than \"customer\\nservice\" in the retail or the  \"bricks and mortars\" business.\\n\\n===========AVAILABLE GUIDES ==============\\nThe reason for the \"cash\" is not because this is illegal or\\nsomehow  \"wrong\". It is simply about time. Time for checks\\nor credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it\\nis simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope\\nand steal it before it gets to you.\\n\\nORDER EACH GUIDE BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.\\nAlways send a single $10 bill (U.S. CURRENCY) for each\\nGuide.  Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is hidden\\nby wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of\\nthose sheets of paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME\\nof the Guide you are ordering, YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS\\nand your name and postal address.  Be sure to address the\\nenvelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps to\\nmail the envelope.\\n\\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE GUIDES NOW\\nFROM THE NAME AND ADDRESS LIST SHOWN\\nAT THE BEGINNING OF THIS EMAIL\\n________________________________________________\\nYOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES\\n\\n=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for GUIDE #1\\nwithin 2 weeks, continue sending emails until you do.\\n\\n=== Two to three weeks after you receive 10 orders,\\nyou should receive 100 orders or more for GUIDE #2. If\\nnot, continue advertising or sending emails until you do.\\n\\nOnce you have received 100 or more orders for GUIDE # 2,\\nYOU CAN SEE THE PROGRAM IS WORKING, and\\ncash should continue coming in! THIS IS IMPORTANT\\nTO REMEMBER:  Continue to assist new buyers with advice\\nand instruction on how to send out more emails. You can\\nKEEP TRACK of progress by noting which guides people\\nare ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE\\nMORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF EMAILS\\nAND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.\\nThere is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate !!!\\n===========================================\\nA NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:\\nYou have just received information that can give you\\nfinancial freedom to really change your life, but I don\\'t\\nwish to kid you:  This requires A BIT OF EFFORT. You\\ncan make more money in the next few weeks and months\\nthan you have ever imagined. Follow the program\\nEXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED.\\n\\nRemember to email the revised copy of this email after you\\nhave put your name and address in GUIDE#1 and moved\\nothers to #2 .....# 5 slots as instructed above. One of the\\npeople you send this to may send out 100,000 or more\\nemails and your name will be on every one of them.\\nRemember, the more you send out the more potential\\nbuyers you will reach.\\n\\nIT IS UP TO YOU!  ORDER THE GUIDES NOW AND\\nEMBARK ON THE ROAD TO FINANCIAL SECURITY!\\n\\nUpon your purchase of any GUIDE #1 through #5, the\\nCopyright owner assigns to you two important rights:\\n(1) The right to resell and to distribute via the internet the\\nGUIDE that you have purchased, and (2) the right to assign\\nto your buyer of the GUIDE, the further right for your buyer\\nto resell that GUIDE.  Included in your purchase of Guide #1\\nis a valuable report on how to market on the Internet. It\\'s\\nfree of charge and will give you the tools you need.\\n\\nThe right to print any of the material contained in the GUIDES\\nis reserved exclusively for the copyright owner.  Your right to\\nresell and to distribute copies of the GUIDE applies only to the\\ninternet and/or world wide web via electronic distribution.\\nYOU MAY NOT PRINT OUT THE GUIDES TO SELL OR\\nDISTRIBUTE IN ANY WAY.  You may print a copy of the\\nGuides for your own personal use to enhance your\\ncommunication skills.\\n\\n===========================================\\n\\n* This message is not intended for residents of localities that\\nhave legal ordinances prohibiting engaging in such programs.\\nScreening of addresses has been done to the best of our ability.\\n\\nThis message is only being sent once to recipients and thus\\nis no need to remove your email address from our mailing\\nlist.

Blonds, It Seems, Will Survive After All\\n\\nOctober 2, 2002\\nBy LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nApparently it fell into the category \"too good to check.\"\\n\\n\\nLast Friday, several British newspapers reported that the\\nWorld Health Organization had found in a study that blonds\\nwould become extinct within 200 years, because blondness\\nwas caused by a recessive gene that was dying out. The\\nreports were repeated on Friday by anchors for the ABC News\\nprogram \"Good Morning America,\" and on Saturday by CNN. \\n\\nThere was only one problem, the health organization said in\\na statement yesterday that it never reported that blonds\\nwould become extinct, and it had never done a study on the\\nsubject. \\n\\n\"W.H.O. has no knowledge of how these news reports\\noriginated,\" said the organization, an agency of the United\\nNations based in Geneva, \"but would like to stress that we\\nhave no opinion of the future existence of blonds.\" \\n\\nAll the news reports, in Britain and the United States,\\ncited a study from the World Health Organization - \"a\\nblonde-shell study,\" as The Daily Star of London put it.\\nBut none reported any scientific details from the study or\\nthe names of the scientists who conducted it. \\n\\nOn \"Good Morning America,\" Charles Gibson began a\\nconversation with his co-anchor, Diane Sawyer, by saying:\\n\"There\\'s a study from the World Health Organization, this\\nis for real, that blonds are an endangered species. Women\\nand men with blond hair, eyebrows and blue eyes, natural\\nblonds, they say will vanish from the face of the earth\\nwithin 200 years, because it is not as strong a gene as\\nbrunets.\" \\n\\nMs. Sawyer said she was \"somewhat of a natural blonde.\"\\n\\n\\nJeffrey Schneider, a spokesman for ABC News, said the\\nanchors got the information from an ABC producer in London\\nwho said he had read it in a British newspaper. \\n\\nIn London, The Sun and The Express both reported that\\nunnamed scientists said blonds would survive longest in\\nScandinavia, where they are most concentrated, and expected\\nthe last true blond to hail from Finland. \\n\\nThe British accounts were replete with the views of\\nbleached blonds who said hairdressers would never allow\\nblondness to become extinct, and doctors who said that rare\\ngenes would pop up to keep natural blonds from becoming an\\nendangered species. \\n\\nJournalists in London said last night that the source of\\nthe reports was probably one of several European news\\nagencies that are used by the British press, but it\\nremained unclear which one. \\n\\nTim Hall, a night news editor at The Daily Mail, said the\\nreport was probably distributed by The Press Association,\\nBritain\\'s domestic news agency. \"Several papers picked it\\nup,\" he said. \\n\\nBut Charlotte Gapper, night editor at The Press\\nAssociation, said that although it had considered running\\nthe report on Sept. 27, it had decided not to after talking\\nto the World Health Organization. \\n\\n\"We didn\\'t do that story because we made an inquiry to the\\nWorld Health Organization first,\" she said. \"They told us\\nthat report was two years old, and had been covered at the\\ntime. They said it had been picked up again that day by a\\nGerman news agency.\" \\n\\nShe added that she did not know which agency the\\norganization was referring to. \\n\\nDr. Ray White, a geneticist at the University of California\\nat San Francisco, said that the disappearance of a gene for\\nblond hair \"sounds patently incorrect.\"\\n\\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/02/health/02BLON.html?ex=1034599071&ei=1&en=3a0e4f0b2b251593\\n\\n\\n\\nHOW TO ADVERTISE\\n---------------------------------\\nFor information on advertising in e-mail newsletters \\nor other creative advertising opportunities with The \\nNew York Times on the Web, please contact\\nonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media \\nkit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo\\n\\nFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to \\nhelp@nytimes.com.  \\n\\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company\\n\\n\\n'},\n",

Know that whether you answered the call or not, you\\'re in the electronic company of some caring and compassionate folks. I\\'ve not yet heard whether a solution has been found from among the many offered, but I\\'ll certainly keep you posted on the outcome.<p>\\n\\nSecond, a few final clarifications on the 4th of July bruhaha. A reader brought to my attention that, though he didn\\'t believe it to be the case, offering my opinion on the state of America could be seen as trolling. That certainly wasn\\'t intended. Also, I\\'ve seen much email over the past week that started with, \"Since you published the opinion of someone outside the US, I\\'d expect that you\\'ll publish an opinion in disagreement.\" Well, I did that already - it was my own opinion that started the discussion. I can clearly see the potential for this to get out of hand. So, this will be the last word on the subject. Thanks for your opinions and your discussion, the vast majority of which was well-thought and reasonable. Both sides were presented and we\\'re moving on.<p>\\n\\nOn to some Lockergnome news. If you haven\\'t already heard, \\n<a href=\"http://www.clevermedia.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CleverMedia</a> is sponsoring karaoke night at <a href=\"http://www.gnomedex.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gnomedex</a>.

This is, quite simply, the fulfillment of the promise of the <a href=\"http://wine.codeweavers.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wine Project</a>. Using this slick little app, virtually all the applications in the Microsoft Office suite are fully functional in Linux. Frankly, I never thought I\\'d see the day when running Windows apps in Linux was exciting. Maybe it\\'s time to take up shucking ice cubes in the blasted lands.<p>\\n\\nLet\\'s break this product up a bit. If purchased as a bundle, both CrossOver Office and <a href=\"http://codeweavers.com/products/crossover/\" target=\"_blank\">CrossOver Plugin</a> (as we discussed yesterday) share an install script. They do, however, require separate install processes, so they need to be launched individually from a shared window.<p>\\n\\nI started the CrossOver Office install, dropped my Office 2000 disc in the CD drive, and fired up the install. It looked and performed exactly as you\\'d expect to see it in Windows. I was able to customize the install, as I always have, then let it run. At the end of the process, CrossOver Office \"fakes\" a Windows reboot and the Office suite installation is complete.<p>\\n\\nEven Internet Explorer 5.0 is installed. There\\'s an option in the CrossOver Office package to install IE 5.5 but, to my chagrin, this was the one area of the install that failed. Actually, the install itself may have succeeded - I was just left without an IE browser following the upgrade. It\\'s hard to tell whether that was a fault in CrossOver Office, or in the IE program itself.<p>\\n\\nFor the most part, these apps perform in Linux as they do in Windows. The IE install was a bit kludgy, with some font problems and an inability to customize the toolbar. Word worked perfectly, allowing me even to pull together legal documents for a friend\\'s business without so much as a hiccup. Even printing works well with the installation of a \"Wine Postscript Printer\" driver.<p>\\n\\nLet me reiterate something I said yesterday. I\\'ve watched the Wine Project walk, then crawl, then walk again over the past few years. I\\'ve always suspected that the fits and starts were not for lack of talent. With the financial backing of CodeWeavers, it appears that my suspicions were well founded. Wine has, through CrossOver Office and CrossOver Plugin, matured to a level of useability that should easily attract Linux users throughout the spectrum of experience. In the big picture, widespread acceptance of these products could remove the last remaining roadblock for many current Windows users to make the leap to Linux: the loss of Word and Excel. They simply don\\'t need to fear those losses any more.<p>\\n\\nA note on the \"for pay\" structure of these products seems in order. As you well know, I\\'m an open source guy through and through. But, this is clearly a case in which the \"free\" efforts of talented and dedicated developers simply wasn\\'t enough to close the gap. The value of these products easily outweighs their minimal cost. And, if it keeps these developers moving forward, it seems to be the perfect pay model for Linux.<p><p>\\n\\n<p align=\"right\"><a class=\"url\" style=\"color: gray; text-decoration: none\" \\nhref=\"http://www.lockergnome.com/recommend.html\">Recommend It!</a><br>\\n<span align=\"right\"><a class=\"url\" style=\"color: gray; text-decoration: none\" href=\"mailto:tony@lockergnome.com?subject=GnomeCORE\">Send us a GnomeTWEAK</a></span>\\n\\n<!-- CORE -->\\n<p><br><table bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tr><td><p \\nclass=\"title\">&nbsp;GnomeCORE</p></td></tr></table><p>\\n\\n<b>Kernel Configuration - Part X</b><p>\\n\\nToday we\\'re looking into the mysteries of Plug and Play support in your Linux kernel configuration.<p>\\n\\nThere\\'s really not much mystery to it. This section simply asks the question, \"Do you want plug and play support in the kernel?\" In other words, do you have all the PCI and ISA devices in your system that you\\'ll ever need to have? If you\\'re set solid with your current machine, there\\'s no use to add the overhead of PnP to your system\\'s kernel code, or as a loadable module. If, on the other hand, you\\'ve got PCI or (on an older system) ISA slots just begging to be filled, build this support into the kernel or select it as modules.<p>\\n\\nSee, this kernel gig isn\\'t really so tough.

       "  'payload': 'BlogStart: \\n\\n**Dublin**: something from the archives.    Daev Walsh forwards an article from\\nThe Irish Digest about \\'\\'Billy in the Bowl\\'\\'.  This story is also immortalised\\nin an old Dublin song, which in turn was mentioned in a Pogues track.  Billy\\nwas a legless beggar in the alleys of Stoneybatter and Grangegorman (where I\\nnow live) during the 18th century, who discovered a new, but not entirely\\nlegal, way to make money.\\n\\nBlogEnd: \\nLinkText: Billy in the Bowl\\n\\nFrom:         daev <hellshaw@fringeware.com>\\nSubject:      The Case of the Stoneybatter Strangler\\n\\nA story of my new neighbourhood...\\n\\n\\nThe Irish Digest July 1964\\n\\n\\nThe Case of the Stoneybatter Strangler\\n\\nThe handsome, deformed Billy in the Bowl evolved a plan to rob his donors.\\nThen, one night, he made the biggest mistake of his life \\n\\nDUBLIN in the eighteenth century was noted for two things - the\\narchitectural beauty of its public buildings and the large number of\\nbeggars who sought alms in its maze of streets and lanes.  Many of these\\nbeggars relied on visitors and the gentry for their coin, but there was one\\nwho campaigned among the working class.  This was \"Billy In The Bowl\"\\n\\nThe strange appellation was derived from the fact that Billy\\'s sole means\\nof transport was a large bowl-shaped car with wheels.  Seated in this \"\\nbowl \", the beggar would propel himself along by pushing against the ground\\nwith wooden plugs, one in each hand.\\n\\nBilly\\'s unusual means of conveyance was vitally necessary, as he had been\\nborn without legs.  Nature, however, had compensated for this by endowing\\nhim with powerful arms and shoulders and, what was most important, an\\nunusually handsome face.\\n\\nThis was Billy\\'s greatest asset in his daily routine of separating\\nsympathetic passers-by from their small change.\\n\\nThe cunning young beggar would wait at a convenient spot on one of the many\\nlonely roads or lanes which were a feature of eighteenth century\\nGrangegorman and Stoneybatter, until a servant girl or an old lady would\\ncome along.\\n\\nHe would then put on is most attractive smile which, together with his\\nblack curly hair, never failed to halt the females.  The fact that such a\\nhandsome young man was so terribly handicapped physically always evoked pity.\\n\\n\"Billy in the Bowl\", however, wasn\\'t satisfied with becoming the daily\\nowner of a generous number of small coins; what his greed demanded were\\nsubstantial sums of money.  The more he managed to get the more he could\\nindulge in his pet vices - gambling and drinking.\\n\\nAs a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers.\\nThe first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold March evening\\nas dusk, was falling.  The victim was a middle aged woman who was passing\\nthrough Grangegorman Lane on her way to visit friends in Queen Street - on\\nDublin\\'s North Quays.\\n\\nWhen Billy heard the woman\\'s footsteps, he hid behind some bushes in a\\nditch which skirted the lane.  As his unsuspecting victim drew close, the\\nbeggar moaned and shouted, and cried out for help.\\n\\nTrembling with excitement, the woman dashed to the spot where Billy lay\\nconcealed.  She bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch, when two\\npowerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes.\\n\\nIn a few minutes it was all over.  The woman lay in a dead faint, and Billy\\nwas travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his \" bowl \", his victirn\\'s\\npurse snug in his coat pocket.  An hour after the robbery the woman was\\nfound in a distracted condition, but failed to give a description of her\\nassailant.  And, as \"Billy in the Bowl\" had figured, nobody would suspect a\\ndeformed beggar.\\n\\nAgain and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan, always shifting\\nthe place of attack to a different part of Grangegorman or  Stoneybatter.\\n\\nOn one occasion \" Billy in \"the Bowl \" tried his tactics on a sturdy\\nservant girl who put up such a vigorous resistance that he was forced to\\nstrangle her.  The incident became known as the 11 Grangegorman Lane Murder\\nand caused a great stir.\\n\\nHundred.s flocked to the scene of the crime and for a couple of months\\n\"Billy in the Bowl\" was forced to desert his usual haunts.  Around this\\nperiod, Dublin\\'s first-ever police force was been mobilised, and the first\\ncase they were confronted with was the Grangegorman lane murder.\\n\\nMonths passed and  \"Billy in the Bowl\" reverted once again to his old\\npasttime.  A number of young servant girls were lured into ditches and\\nrobbed, and the police were inundated with so many complaints that a\\nnightly patrol was placed on the district.  But the beggar still rolled\\nalong in his \"bowl\" pitied and unsuspected.  Then came the night that\\nfinished Billy\\'s career of crime.\\n\\nTwo stoudy built female cooks, trudging back to their places of employment\\nafter a night out in the city, were surprised and not a little shocked to\\nhear shouts for help.  Rushing over, they came upon a huddled figure in the\\nditch.\\n\\nBilly, thinking there was only one woman, grabbed one of the cooks and\\ntried to pull her into the ditch.  She proved much too strong for him,\\nhowever) and while resisting tore \\'at his face with her sharp finger-nails.\\n\\nMeanwhile, her companion acted with speed and daring.  Pulling out her\\nlarge hatpin she made .for the beggar, and plunged the pin into his right eye.\\n\\nThe screams and howls of the wounded beggar reverberated throughout the\\ndistrict and brought people dashing to the scene.  Among them was a member\\nof the nightly police patrol who promptly arrested the groaning Billy.\\n\\n\"Billy in the Bowl\" was tried and sentenced for robbery with violence, but\\nthey could never prove it was he who had strangled the servant girl.  The\\nGrangegorman-Stoneybatter district became once again a quiet, attractive\\nDublin suburb where old ladies strolled, and carefree servant girls laughed\\nand giggled as they wended their way home at night.\\n\\n\\n\\ndaev\\n\\n_______________________________\\nRev.

It is a matter of segmenting a market, and manufacturers want \\r\\nnetbooks to have specific capabilities for marketing reasons, not \\r\\ntechnical ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wanted to suggest that you choose a machine based on your needs, and I \\r\\nwanted you to question your initial assumptions.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, I see you have done some thinking about it, and future-proofing \\r\\n*does* seem like a good reason to get a dual-core, 64-bit machine.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith 64 bits, you will need more memory, so I suggest you look for a \\r\\nmachine that can use 4 GB of memory.\\r\\n\\r\\nI suggest also that you make sure that the machine you get can use \\r\\nsolid-state storage devices.  In time, the advantages of SSDs will make \\r\\nthem compelling, though now they are too expensive.  That is, you will \\r\\nprobably buy a machine with a standard notebook HD, but if you ever need \\r\\nto replace it, being able to replace it with an SSD gives you another \\r\\noption.  This also is in the area of future-proofing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJust a couple of suggestions.  I would like to hear more from other \\r\\npeople.  (I am also contemplating a portable computer purchase.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMAA\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n-- \\r\\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \\r\\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".

For example, you could have an <code>ArrayList</code> of Strings, or a <code>LinkedList</code> of Integers. This tip compares the performance of <code>ArrayList</code> and <code>LinkedList</code>, and offers some suggestions about which of these classes is the right choice in a given situation.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nThe first key point is that an <code>ArrayList</code> is backed by a primitive <code>Object</code> array. Because of that, an <code>ArrayList</code> is much faster than a <code>LinkedList</code> for random access, that is, when accessing arbitrary list elements using the <code>get</code> method. Note that the <code>get</code> method is implemented for <code>LinkedLists</code>, but it requires a sequential scan from the front or back of the list. This scan is very slow. For a <code>LinkedList</code>, there\\'s no fast way to access the Nth element of the list.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>\\nConsider the following example. Suppose you have a large list of sorted elements, either an <code>ArrayList</code> or a <code>LinkedList</code>. Suppose too that you do a binary search on the list. The standard binary search algorithm starts by checking the search key against the value in the middle of the list. If the middle value is too high, then the upper half of the list is eliminated. However, if the middle value is too low, then the lower half of the list is ignored. This process continues until the key is found in the list, or until the lower bound of the search becomes greater than the upper bound.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nHere\\'s a program that does a binary search on all the elements in an <code>ArrayList</code> or a <code>LinkedList</code>:\\n</p>\\n\\n<pre>\\n    import java.util.*;\\n\\n    public class ListDemo1 {\\n        static final int N = 10000;\\n\\n        static List values;\\n\\n        // make List of increasing Integer values\\n\\n        static {\\n           Integer vals[] = new Integer[N];\\n\\n           Random rn = new Random();\\n\\n           for (int i = 0, currval = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {\\n               vals[i] = new Integer(currval);\\n               currval += rn.nextInt(100) + 1;\\n           }\\n\\n           values = Arrays.asList(vals);\\n        }\\n        \\n        // iterate across a list and look up every\\n        // value in the list using binary search\\n\\n        static long timeList(List lst) {\\n            long start = System.currentTimeMillis();\\n\\n            for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {\\n\\n               // look up a value in the list \\n               // using binary search\\n\\n               int indx = Collections.binarySearch(\\n                                   lst, values.get(i));\\n\\n               // sanity check for result \\n               // of binary search\\n\\n               if (indx != i) {\\n                   System.out.println(\\n                                    &quot;*** error ***\\\\n&quot;);\\n               }\\n           }\\n\\n           return System.currentTimeMillis() - start;\\n       }\\n\\n       public static void main(String args[]) {\\n\\n           // do lookups in an ArrayList \\n\\n           System.out.println(&quot;time for ArrayList = &quot; +\\n               timeList(new ArrayList(values)));\\n\\n           // do lookups in a LinkedList\\n\\n           System.out.println(\\n               &quot;time for LinkedList = &quot; +\\n               timeList(new LinkedList(values)));\\n       }\\n    }\\n</pre>\\n\\n<p>\\nThe <code>ListDemo1</code> program sets up a <code>List</code> of sorted Integer values. It then adds the values to an <code>ArrayList</code> or a <code>LinkedList</code>. Then <code>Collections.binarySearch</code> is used to search for each value in the \\nlist.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nWhen you run this program, you should see a result that looks something like this:\\n</p>\\n\\n<pre>\\n    time for ArrayList = 31\\n\\n    time for LinkedList = 4640\\n</pre>\\n\\n<p>\\n<code>ArrayList</code> is about 150 times faster than <code>LinkedList</code>. (Your results might differ depending on your machine characteristics, but you should see a distinct difference in the result for <code>ArrayList</code> as compared to that for <code>LinkedList</code>. The same is true for the other programs in this tip.) Clearly, <code>LinkedList</code> is a bad choice in this situation. The binary search algorithm inherently uses random access, and <code>LinkedList</code> does not support fast random access. The time to do a random access in a <code>LinkedList</code> is proportional to the size of the list. By comparison, random access in an <code>ArrayList</code> has a fixed time.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nYou can use the <code>RandomAccess</code> marker interface to check whether a List supports fast random access:\\n</p>\\n\\n<pre>\\n    void f(List lst) {\\n        if (lst instanceof RandomAccess) {\\n            // supports fast random access\\n        }\\n    }\\n</pre>\\n\\n<p>\\n<code>ArrayList</code> implements the <code>RandomAccess</code> interface, and <code>LinkedList</code>. does not. Note that <code>Collections.binarySearch</code> does take advantage of the <code>RandomAccess</code> property, to optimize searches.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nDo these results prove that <code>ArrayList</code> is always a better choice? Not necessarily. There are many cases where <code>LinkedList</code> does better. Also note that there are many situations where an algorithm can be implemented efficiently for <code>LinkedList</code>. An example is reversing a <code>LinkedList</code> using <code>Collections.reverse</code>. The internal algorithm does this, and gets reasonable performance, by using forward and backward iterators.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nLet\\'s look at another example. Suppose you have a list of elements, and you do a lot of element inserting and deleting to the list. In this case, <code>LinkedList</code> is the better choice. To demonstrate that, consider the following &quot;worst case&quot; scenario. In this demo, a program repeatedly inserts elements at the beginning of a list. The code looks like this:\\n</p>\\n\\n<pre>\\n    import java.util.*;\\n\\n    public class ListDemo2 {\\n        static final int N = 50000;\\n\\n        // time how long it takes to add \\n        // N objects to a list\\n\\n        static long timeList(List lst) {\\n            long start = System.currentTimeMillis();\\n\\n            Object obj = new Object();\\n\\n            for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {\\n                lst.add(0, obj);\\n            }\\n\\n            return System.currentTimeMillis() - start;\\n        }\\n\\n        public static void main(String args[]) {\\n\\n            // do timing for ArrayList\\n\\n            System.out.println(\\n                &quot;time for ArrayList = &quot; +\\n                timeList(new ArrayList()));\\n\\n            // do timing for LinkedList\\n\\n            System.out.println(\\n                &quot;time for LinkedList = &quot; +\\n                timeList(new LinkedList()));\\n        }\\n    } \\n</pre>\\n\\n<p>\\nWhen you run this program, the result should look something like this:\\n</p>\\n\\n<pre>\\n    time for ArrayList = 4859\\n\\n    time for LinkedList = 125\\n</pre>\\n\\n<p>\\nThese results are pretty much the reverse of the previous example.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nWhen an element is added to the beginning of an <code>ArrayList</code>, all of the existing elements must be pushed back, which means a lot of expensive data movement and copying. By contrast, adding an element to the beginning of a <code>LinkedList</code> simply means allocating an internal record for the element and then adjusting a couple of links. Adding to the beginning of a <code>LinkedList</code> has fixed cost, but adding to the beginning of an <code>ArrayList</code> has a cost that\\'s proportional to the list size.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nSo far, this tip has looked at speed issues, but what about space? Let\\'s look at some internal details of how <code>ArrayList</code> and <code>LinkedList</code> are implemented in Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition v 1.4. These details are not part of the external specification of these classes, but are illustrative of how such classes work internally.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nThe <code>LinkedList</code> class has a private internal class defined like this:\\n</p>\\n\\n<pre>\\n    private static class Entry {\\n        Object element;\\n        Entry next;\\n        Entry previous;\\n    } \\n</pre>\\n\\n\\n<p>\\nEach <code>Entry</code> object references a list element, along with the next and previous elements in the <code>LinkedList</code> -- in other words, a doubly-linked list. A <code>LinkedList</code> of 1000 elements will have 1000 <code>Entry</code> objects linked together, referencing the actual list elements. There is significant space overhead in a <code>LinkedList</code> structure, given all these <code>Entry</code> objects.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nAn <code>ArrayList</code> has a backing <code>Object</code> array to store the elements. This array starts with a capacity of 10. When the array needs to grow, the new capacity is computed as:\\n</p>\\n\\n<pre>\\n    newCapacity = (oldCapacity * 3) / 2 + 1;\\n</pre>\\n\\n<p>\\nNotice that the array capacity grows each time by about 50%. This means that if you have an <code>ArrayList</code> with a large number of elements, there will be a significant amount of space wasted at the end. This waste is intrinsic to the way <code>ArrayList</code> works. If there was no spare capacity, the array would have to be reallocated for each new element, and performance would suffer dramatically. Changing the growth strategy to be more aggressive (such as doubling the size at each reallocation) would result in slightly better performance, but it would waste more space.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nIf you know how many elements will be in an <code>ArrayList</code>, you can specify the capacity to the constructor. You can also call the <code>trimToSize</code> method after the fact to reallocate the internal array. This gets rid of the wasted space.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nSo far, this discussion has assumed that either an <code>ArrayList</code> or a <code>LinkedList</code> is &quot;right&quot; for a given application. But sometimes, other choices make more sense. For example, consider the very common situation where you have a list of key/value pairs, and you would like to retrieve a value for a given key.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nYou could store the pairs in an N x 2 <code>Object</code> array. To find the right pair, you could do a sequential search on the key values. This approach works, and is a useful choice for very small lists (say 10 elements or less), but it doesn\\'t scale to big lists.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nAnother approach is to sort the key/value pairs by ascending key value, store the result in a pair of <code>ArrayLists</code>, and then do a binary search on the keys list. This approach also works, and is very fast. Yet another approach is to not use a list structure at all, but instead use a map structure (hash table), in the form of a <code>HashMap</code>.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nWhich is faster, a binary search on an <code>ArrayList</code>, or a <code>HashMap</code>? Here\\'s a final example that compares these two:\\n</p>\\n\\n<pre>\\n    import java.util.*;\\n\\n    public class ListDemo3 {\\n        static final int N = 500000;\\n\\n        // Lists of keys and values\\n\\n        static List keys;\\n        static List values;\\n\\n        // fill the keys list with ascending order key \\n        // values and fill the values list with\\n        // corresponding values (-key)\\n\\n        static {\\n            Integer keyvec[] = new Integer[N];\\n            Integer valuevec[] = new Integer[N];\\n\\n            Random rn = new Random();\\n\\n            for (int i = 0, currval = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {\\n                keyvec[i] = new Integer(currval);\\n                valuevec[i] = new Integer(-currval);\\n                currval += rn.nextInt(100) + 1;\\n            }\\n\\n            keys = Arrays.asList(keyvec);\\n            values = Arrays.asList(valuevec);\\n        }\\n\\n        // fill a Map with key/value pairs\\n\\n        static Map map = new HashMap();\\n\\n        static {\\n            for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {\\n                map.put(keys.get(i), values.get(i));\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        // do binary search lookup of all keys\\n\\n        static long timeList() {\\n            long start = System.currentTimeMillis();\\n\\n            for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {\\n                int indx = Collections.binarySearch(\\n                                    keys, keys.get(i));\\n\\n                // sanity check of returned value \\n                // from binary search\\n\\n                if (indx != i) {\\n                    System.out.println(\\n                                    &quot;*** error ***\\\\n&quot;);\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            return System.currentTimeMillis() - start;\\n        }\\n\\n        // do Map lookup of all keys\\n\\n        static long timeMap() {\\n            long start = System.currentTimeMillis();\\n\\n            for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {\\n                Integer value = (Integer)map.get(\\n                                          keys.get(i));\\n\\n                // sanity check of value returned \\n                // from map lookup\\n\\n                if (value != values.get(i)) {\\n                    System.out.println(\\n                                    &quot;*** error ***\\\\n&quot;);\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            return System.currentTimeMillis() - start;\\n        }\\n\\n        public static void main(String args[]) {\\n\\n            // do timing for List implementation\\n\\n            System.out.println(\"List time = \" + \\n                                           timeList());\\n\\n            // do timing for Map implementation\\n\\n            System.out.println(&quot;Map time = &quot; + \\n                                            timeMap());\\n        }\\n    }\\n</pre>\\n\\n<p>\\nThe program sets up <code>Lists</code> of keys and values, and then uses two different techniques to map keys to values. One approach uses a binary search on a list, the other a hash table.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nWhen you run the <code>ListDemo3</code> program, you should get a result that looks something like this:\\n</p>\\n\\n<pre>\\n    ArrayList time = 1000\\n\\n    HashMap time = 281\\n</pre>\\n\\n<p>\\nIn this example, N has a value of 500000. Approximately, log2(N) - 1 comparisons are required in an average successful binary search, so each binary search lookup in the <code>ArrayList</code> will take about 18 comparisons. By contrast, a properly implemented hash table typically requires only 1-3 comparisons. So you should expect the hash table to be faster in this case.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nHowever, binary search is still useful. For example, you might want to do a lookup in a sorted list and then find keys that are close in value to the key used for the lookup. Doing this is easy with binary search, but impossible in a hash table. Keys in a hash table are stored in apparent random order. Also, if you are concerned with worst-case performance, the binary search algorithm offers a much stronger performance guarantee than a hash table scheme. You might also consider using TreeMap for doing lookups in sorted collections of key/value pairs.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nLet\\'s summarize the key points presented in this tip:\\n</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n  <li>Appending elements to the end of a list has a fixed averaged cost for both <code>ArrayList</code> and <code>LinkedList.</code> For <code>ArrayList</code>, appending typically involves setting an internal array location to the element reference, but occasionally results in the array being reallocated. For <code>LinkedList</code>, the cost is uniform and involves allocating an internal <code>Entry</code> object.</li>\\n\\n  <li>Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of an <code>ArrayList</code> implies that the rest of the list must be moved.

You have some raw data that you want to clean up and process in various ways. One of the methods you\\'ve written takes an array of integers, along with minimum and maximum values. The method goes through the array and eliminates &quot;outliers,&quot; that is, values that are too small or too big. The result of the filtering process is a new array of cleaned-up data.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nHow could you implement this kind of filtering method? Here\\'s one approach:\\n</p>\\n\\n<pre>\\n    import java.util.*;\\n    \\n    public class ZeroDemo1 {\\n    \\n        // filter input array and throw away values \\n        // that are less than minval or greater than \\n        // maxval\\n    \\n        static int[] filterData(\\n                int indata[], int minval, int maxval) {\\n    \\n            // check parameters for errors \\n    \\n            if (indata == null) {\\n                throw new NullPointerException(\\n                                     &quot;indata is null&quot;);\\n            }\\n            if (maxval &lt; minval) {\\n                throw new IllegalArgumentException(\\n                &quot;maxval &lt; minval&quot;);\\n            }\\n    \\n            // count number of valid values \\n            // in input array\\n    \\n            int validcnt = 0;\\n            for (int i = 0; i &lt; indata.length; i++) {\\n                if (indata[i] &gt;= minval &amp;&amp; indata[i] \\n                                         &lt;= maxval) {\\n                    validcnt++;\\n                }\\n            }\\n    \\n            // if no valid values, return null\\n    \\n            if (validcnt == 0) {\\n                return null;\\n            }\\n    \\n            // copy valid values to new array \\n            // and return it\\n    \\n            int outdata[] = new int[validcnt];\\n            for (int i = 0, j = 0; \\n                              i &lt; indata.length; i++) {\\n                if (indata[i] &gt;= minval &amp;&amp; indata[i] \\n                                           &lt;= maxval) {\\n                    outdata[j++] = indata[i];\\n                }\\n            }\\n            return outdata;\\n        }\\n    \\n        public static void main(String args[]) {\\n    \\n            // set up test array of integers\\n    \\n            int indata[] = new int[]{1, 3, -17, 8, 59};\\n    \\n            // filter out values not in the range 1-10\\n    \\n            int outdata1[] = filterData(indata, 1, 10);\\n            for (int i = 0; i &lt; outdata1.length; i++) {\\n                System.out.println(outdata1[i]);\\n            }\\n    \\n            // filter out values not \\n            // in the range 100-200\\n    \\n            int outdata2[] = filterData(\\n                                     indata, 100, 200);\\n            for (int i = 0; i &lt; outdata2.length; i++) {\\n                System.out.println(outdata2[i]);\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n</pre>\\n\\n<p>\\nThe <code>filterData</code> method does two scans of the input array. The first scan counts the number of valid data values. Then the method allocates a new array of the appropriate size, and copies the good values to it. If there are no good values, the method returns a null value for the array reference.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nThe result of running the <code>ZeroDemo1</code> program is:\\n</p>\\n\\n<pre>\\n    1\\n    3\\n    8\\n    Exception in thread &quot;main&quot;\\n    java.lang.NullPointerException\\n        at ZeroDemo1.main(ZeroDemo1.java:72)\\n</pre>\\n\\n<p>\\nThe problem with this program is a rather basic one. The second call of <code>filterData</code> returns a null value, and the program fails to take this possibility into account.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nA better approach in this example would be to comment out the block of code that tests for the possibility of no valid data values:\\n</p>\\n\\n<pre>\\n    /*\\n    if (validcnt == 0) {\\n        return null;\\n    }\\n    */\\n</pre>\\n\\n<p>\\nWhen there is no valid data, the code will fall through to the next line, where a zero-length array is allocated:\\n</p>\\n\\n<pre>\\n    int outdata[] = new int[0];\\n</pre>\\n\\n<p>\\nThis is perfectly legal Java usage. The representation of Java arrays includes the length of the array, and it\\'s therefore possible to tell if an array has zero length.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nFor the <code>ZeroDemo1</code> example, if you anticipate that validcnt will often be zero, that is, data filtering will often eliminate all values from the input, then you could optimize away the second input scan by adding code like this:\\n</p>\\n\\n<pre>\\n    int outdata[] = new int[validcnt];\\n    if (validcnt == 0) {\\n        return outdata;\\n    }\\n</pre>\\n\\n<p>\\nNote that usage such as:\\n</p>\\n\\n<pre>\\n    int outdata[] = new int[]{};\\n</pre>\\n\\n<p>\\nis also legal, to initialize an array with a zero-length set of integer constants.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nIn general, it\\'s best not to return null from a method that returns an array type. Always returning an array, even if the array has zero length, greatly improves the generality of algorithms. If you anticipate that your methods will often return zero-length arrays, you might be concerned about the performance implications of allocating many such arrays. In this case, you can allocate a single array, and always return the same one, as follows:\\n</p>\\n\\n<pre>\\n    private static final int ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAY[] = \\n                                            new int[0];\\n</pre>\\n\\n<p>\\nThis array is immutable (it can\\'t be changed), and can be shared throughout your application.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nThere\\'s another way that zero-length arrays are used, as illustrated in the following example:\\n</p>\\n\\n<pre>\\n    import java.util.*;\\n    \\n    public class ZeroDemo2 {\\n        public static void main(String args[]) {\\n    \\n            // set up ArrayList and add strings to it\\n    \\n            List stringlist = new ArrayList();\\n            stringlist.add(&quot;string 1&quot;);\\n            stringlist.add(&quot;string 2&quot;);\\n            stringlist.add(&quot;string 3&quot;);\\n    \\n            // convert to String array\\n    \\n            String out[] = (\\n                          String[])stringlist.toArray(\\n            new String[0]);\\n            for (int i = 0; i &lt; out.length; i++) {\\n                System.out.println(out[i]);\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n</pre>\\n\\n<p>\\nThe result of running the <code>ZeroDemo2</code> program is:\\n</p>\\n\\n<pre>\\n    string 1\\n    string 2\\n    string 3\\n</pre>\\n\\n<p>\\nThe <code>ZeroDemo2</code> program sets up an <code>ArrayList</code>, and adds three strings to it. Then the program calls <code>toArray</code> to get a <code>String</code> array of the three elements in the <code>ArrayList</code>. In this example, the argument to <code>toArray</code> is &quot;new String[0]&quot;. This argument serves a couple of purposes. First, if you have a <code>String</code> array that\\'s big enough to hold the elements of the <code>ArrayList</code>, you can specify it as the argument to <code>toArray</code>. The method will use the <code>String</code> array.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nBut if your array is not big enough, then the <code>toArray</code> method allocates an array to return the elements. It uses the type of the array that was passed in to determine the type of the allocated array. <code>ArrayList</code> stores its element references in an <code>Object</code> array. The <code>toArray</code> method needs to be told if there is some other type (such as String) to be used for returning the array of elements. The method uses reflection (<code>java.lang.reflect.Array.newInstance</code>) to create an array of the appropriate type.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nFor more information about using zero-Length arrays, see item 27 &quot;Return zero-length arrays, not nulls&quot; in &quot;<a href=\"http://java.sun.com/docs/books/effective/?s=04&w=37\" target=\"_blank\">Effective Java Programming Language Guide</a>&quot; by Joshua Bloch.\\n</p>\\n\\n<table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\">\\n<tr>\\n<td>\\n<div align=\"right\">\\n<a href=\"#top\">back to top<img src=\"http://developer.java.sun.com/images/back_to_top.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Pixel\"></a>\\n</div>\\n</td></tr>\\n\\n<tr><td bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" height=\"2\"><img src=\"http://developer.java.sun.com/images/pixel.gif\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" ALT=\"Pixel\" border=\"0\"></td></tr>\\n\\n<!-- Grey Horizontal Line Begins Here -->\\n\\n<tr>\\n<td bgcolor=\"#cccccc\" height=\"1\"><img src=\"http://developer.java.sun.com/images/pixel.gif\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" ALT=\"Pixel\" border=\"0\"></td>\\n</tr>\\n</table> \\n\\n<!-- Grey Horizontal Line ends Here -->\\n<br>\\n\\n<span class=\"small\">IMPORTANT: Please read our Terms of Use, Privacy, and Licensing policies:<br>\\n<a href=\"http://www.sun.com/share/text/termsofuse.html?s=04&w=37\"><span class=\"link\">http://www.sun.com/share/text/termsofuse.html</span></a><br>\\n<a href=\"http://www.sun.com/privacy/?s=04&w=37\"><span class=\"link\">http://www.sun.com/privacy/</span></a><br>\\n<a href=\"http://developer.java.sun.com/berkeley_license.html?s=04&w=37\"><span class=\"link\">http://developer.java.sun.com/berkeley_license.html</span></a>\\n</span><br><br>\\n\\n<span class=\"small\">\\nComments?

       "  'payload': 'The Scotsman\\n\\n Thu 22 Aug 2002 \\n\\n Meaningful sentences \\n \\n Tracey Lawson \\n \\n \\n If you ever wanted to look like \"one of the most dangerous inmates in prison\\n history\", as one judge described Charles Bronson, now\\x92s your chance. Bronson -\\n the serial hostage taker, not the movie star - has written a health and\\n fitness guide in which he shares some of the secrets behind his legendary\\n muscle power. \\n \\n Solitary Fitness - a title which bears testament to the fact that Bronson, 48,\\n has spent 24 of his 28 prison years in solitary confinement - explains how he\\n has turned himself into a lean, mean, fitness machine while living 23 hours a\\n day in a space just 12 feet by eight feet, on a diet of scrubs grub and at\\n virtually no cost. \\n \\n The book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without spending a\\n fortune on gym memberships, protein supplements or designer trainers, and\\n starts with a fierce attack on some of the expensive myths churned out by the\\n exercise industry. \\n \\n \"I pick up a fitness mag, I start to laugh and I wipe my arse with it,\" is the\\n opening paragraph penned by Bronson. \"It\\x92s a joke and a big con and they call\\n me a criminal!\" You can\\x92t help feeling he has a point. \\n \\n This is not the first book that Bronson has written from behind bars, having\\n already published Birdman Opens His Mind, which features drawings and poems\\n created by Bronson while in prison. And he is not the first prisoner to\\n discover creative expression while residing at Her Majesty\\x92s pleasure. \\n \\n Jimmy Boyle, the Scots sculptor and novelist, discovered his artistic talents\\n when he was sent to Barlinnie Prison\\x92s famous special unit, which aimed to\\n help inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how to\\n express their emotions artistically. Boyle was sentenced to life for the\\n murder of \"Babs\" Rooney in 1967. Once released, he moved to Edinburgh where he\\n has become a respected artist. His first novel, Hero of the Underworld, was\\n published in 1999 and his autobiography, A Sense of Freedom, was made into an\\n award-winning film. \\n \\n Hugh Collins was jailed for life in 1977 for the murder of William Mooney in\\n Glasgow, and in his first year in Barlinnie prison stabbed three prison\\n officers, earning him an extra seven-year sentence. But, after being\\n transferred to the same unit that Boyle attended, he learned to sculpt and\\n developed an interest in art. He later published Autobiography of a Murderer,\\n a frank account of Glasgow\\x92s criminal culture in the 1960s, which received\\n critical praise. \\n \\n And Lord Archer doesn\\x92t seem to have had trouble continuing to write the books\\n that have made him millions while in jail. He recently signed a three-book\\n deal with Macmillan publishers worth a reported \\xa310 million, and is no doubt\\n scribbling away as we speak. \\n \\n So why is it that men like Collins, Bronson and Boyle, who can be so\\n destructive towards society on the outside, can become so creative once stuck\\n on the inside? Steve Richards, Bronson\\x92s publisher, has published many books\\n about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both\\n pragmatic and profound. \\n \\n He says: \"Prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have\\n known a stable environment, and this can be the first time they have the\\n chance to focus on their creative skills. \\n \\n \"It may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of an\\n education, if their early years have been hard. It could be the first time\\n anyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents.\" \\n \\n However, Richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that. He says:\\n \"Once they are behind bars, the cold light of day hits them, and they examine\\n the very essence of who they are. \\n \\n \"They ask themselves, am I a man who wants to be remembered for violence? Or\\n am I a man who can contribute to society, who can be remembered for something\\n good?\" \\n \\n Bronson - who was born Michael Gordon Peterson, but changed his name to that\\n of the Hollywood star of the Death Wish films - has, so far, been remembered\\n mainly for things bad. He was originally jailed for seven years for armed\\n robbery in 1974, and has had a series of sentences added to his original term\\n over the years as a result of attacking people in prison. In 2000 he was\\n jailed for life after being convicted of holding a teacher hostage for nearly\\n two days during a jail siege. \\n \\n Standing five feet ten and a half inches tall and weighing 210lbs, he is\\n renowned for his strength. He has bent metal cell doors with his bare hands\\n and does up to 3,000 - yes, 3,000 - press-ups a day. As he puts it: \"I can hit\\n a man 20 times in four seconds, I can push 132 press ups in 60 seconds.\" \\n \\n But judging by our current obsession with health and exercise, Solitary\\n Fitness might be the book which will see Bronson\\x92s face sitting on every\\n coffee table in the land. He might be the man to give us the dream body which\\n so many so-called fitness gurus promise but fail to motivate us into. Because\\n Bronson has learned to use words as powerfully as he can use his fists. \\n \\n \"All this crap about high-protein drinks, pills, diets, it\\x92s just a load of\\n bollocks and a multi-million-pound racket,\" he writes, in what can only be\\n described as a refreshingly honest style. \"We can all be fat lazy bastards,\\n it\\x92s our choice, I\\x92m sick of hearing and reading about excuses, if you stuff\\n your face with shit you become shit, that\\x92s logical to me.\" \\n \\n As motivational mantras go, that might be just the kick up the, er, backside\\n we all needed. \\n \\n \\n Solitary Fitness by Charles Bronson is published by Mirage Publishing and will\\n be available in bookstores from October at \\xa37.99\\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

       "  'payload': \"So, like many young children, my daughter Tatum (age 21 months) *really*\\nlikes music. She also likes to have control over her environment, and this\\nmeans she wants to be the one putting CDs into the CD player, and getting\\nthe music playing.\\n\\nBy watching Tatum, I've discovered that you can learn a lot about UI design\\nfrom watching 21-month-olds use technology. There is definitely a market\\nniche for a toddler-friendly CD/MP3 player.\\n\\nThe CD player we have combines play and pause in a single button, but\\ndoesn't provide *instantaneous* feedback that the button was pushed, instead\\nrequiring you to wait until the music starts, 5-10 seconds. This is a UI\\ndisaster. Since Tatum doesn't get feedback right away, she presses the\\nbutton again, thereby pausing the CD before it even plays. She'll only ever\\nget music if she presses the button an odd number of times. This happens a\\nsurprising amount of the time, since she eventually hits the button again\\nwhen the music doesn't play.\\n\\nFor toddlers, pressing play must cause the music to start immediately,\\nwithin half a second, for the toddler to get the causality and not press the\\nbutton multiple times. As well, pressing the button multiple times shouldn't\\nchange the semantics, like an elevator button. No matter how many times you\\npress, the elevator still comes to that floor. The play button needs to be\\nthe same.\\n\\nThe back-hinged door mechanism feeding the CD into the player is also a UI\\ndisaster for Tatum. Since the door hinges on the back, Tatum has to angle\\nCDs to put them in, and take them out. Putting CDs in isn't much of a\\nproblem, but taking them out is. Since Tatum grabs CDs by the back edge,\\nthat edge comes out first, hitting the lid. Tatum eventually forces and\\nwiggles the CD out, a process that's hard on the CD and the player (but\\nwhich hasn't yet resulted in the CD player being broken). Surprisingly, it\\nhasn't been a problem getting the CD hole onto the spindle -- Tatum seems to\\nunderstand this concept, and the CD load area geometry naturally guides the\\nCD.\\n\\nTatum's CD player also plays tapes and has FM radio. For a toddler, this is\\na mistake. Tatum doesn't understand the need to flick a switch to put the\\nplayer into a specific mode. She understands putting a CD in, and pressing\\nthe play button. She sometimes understands the buttons for advancing a song,\\nbut uses them erratically. As well, the radio feature has both FM mono and\\nFM stero, a distinction totally lost on Tatum. Tatum only understands the\\nbinary distinction of music/no music.\\n\\nWhat would the ideal toddler CD player be like? It would immediately start\\nplaying a CD after it was loaded. As soon as the CD load door was closed, it\\nwould give some audible feedback. It would have a single large play button.\\nThe other typical CD controls would be larger than normal, but at least half\\nthe size of the play button, and located far away from the play button, so\\nthere is no chance of them getting accidentally pressed on the way to play.\\nThe play button would be a bright color that is different from the color of\\nthe player, and different from the color of the other CD control keys. The\\ndevice would only play CDs, no other functions. The CD load area would flip\\nopen at least 80 degrees. It should be small, approachable for a toddler. It\\nshould be possible to repeatedly drop the player from a height of 1-2'\\nwithout affecting the player.\\n\\n- Jim\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"},\n",

It\\'s in dmesg somewhere.  When the\\r\\nfirmware doesn\\'t load you get something like this in dmesg:\\r\\n\\r\\neth1: RTL8168d/8111d at 0xffffc90000c4e000,xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx, XID 083000c0\\r\\nIRQ 32\\r\\neth1: unable to apply firmware patch\\r\\n\\r\\nThat\\'s a paste from one of the OPs here who was bitten by the 2.6.32-trunk\\r\\nupgrade which IIRC is the one that ripped out the RTL firmware blob.\\r\\n\\r\\nI can\\'t find via Google a dmesg snippet of a successful RTL firmware load.\\r\\nHere\\'s what it looks like for Intel 8255X using the e100 driver, with the\\r\\nfirmware blobs all compiled into the kernel:\\r\\n\\r\\ne100 0000:00:0d.0: firmware: using built-in firmware e100/d101m_ucode.bin\\r\\n\\r\\n\"built-in\" signifies that the firmware blob has been included in the kernel\\r\\nat compile time.  I do this to avoid issues such as this RTL problem.  It\\r\\nonly adds a couple hundred K to the kernel image.  And I use the vanilla\\r\\nkernel.org sources to avoid any Debian \"non-free\" issues.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust about every NIC on the planet uses a firmware blob.  There are, IIRC, 3\\r\\nways to load the device firmware into the Linux kernel.  This applies to all\\r\\ndevices that require soft firmware, not just NICs:\\r\\n\\r\\n1.

They thought it was a udev issue til I noticed the\\r\\nfirmware load failure message referenced up above in this email.  The other\\r\\nhad an RTL wireless that failed for the same reason.  I can\\'t recall how\\r\\nthey fixed that one.  IIRC the OP didn\\'t swap hardware to achieve the fix,\\r\\nso they did something with the kernel/driver/firmware.\\r\\n\\r\\n> I\\'m not surprised.

I bet you get 1/3rd wire\\r\\nspeed at best, about 30MB/s, if even that.  The machines themselves need to\\r\\nbe modern to saturate the link--no slow CPUs or disks.  Any ~2GHz CPU with\\r\\n512MB RAM and a decent 7.2K RPM SATA disk should be able to push/pull 50MB/s\\r\\nacross the wire.  For that matter, eliminate the disk by creating a 200MB\\r\\nRAM disk on each machine.  Create a test file with dd and FTP/SCP it back\\r\\nand forth between the RAM disks.

       "  'payload': '\\r\\nI\\'m looking for a good battery charge/discharge profiler tool for my=20\\r\\nUbuntu laptop. I\\'m aware that there\\'s the \"Power History\" tool, but it=20\\r\\ndoesn\\'t seem to do what I\\'m after. I\\'ll explain....\\r\\n\\r\\nA couple of years ago, I came across a really neat tool for Windows for=20\\r\\nestimating the time remaining until the battery is completely charged or =\\r\\n\\r\\ndischarged. It was pretty clever about how it went about it. It would=20\\r\\nconstantly record things like: how much charge the battery said it still =\\r\\n\\r\\nhad, how much the battery said it was charging/discharging at, etc. The=20\\r\\ntool would use this info to estimate the time to charge/discharge...=20\\r\\n/but/ it also went one step further. It could account for errors in the=20\\r\\nbattery\\'s reporting. For example, if the battery reported that it had=20\\r\\n80% charge left, and then, a few minutes later, reported that it had=20\\r\\njust 20% left, then this tool would learn this, and realize that the=20\\r\\nbattery was old/problematic. So, the /next/ time the battery was=20\\r\\nreporting 80% charge left, the tool would know not to give too=20\\r\\noptimistic of an estimate for the remaining time. In other words, the=20\\r\\ntool was learning what \"80%\" /really/ meant to that battery.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt also did something else which was really cool. Because the battery=20\\r\\ndrains at different rates depending upon what you\\'re doing with your=20\\r\\nlaptop (ie, playing a DVD on a bright screen versus just reading some=20\\r\\ntext on a dimmer screen), this tool would actually show you \"best case\"=20\\r\\nand \"worst case\" predictions of your remaining battery life (or time to=20\\r\\ncharge back up) based upon /actual/ discharge rates from /that level/ of =\\r\\n\\r\\nbattery charge remaining that it had experienced on /that/ laptop. So,=20\\r\\nyou\\'d open up the little power-discharge graph tool and you\\'d see three=20\\r\\nlines: a best, a worst, and one in-between which was what rate you\\'re=20\\r\\ncurrently at.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, two questions:\\r\\n1 - Does anyone know what tool that was? (Yes, I know this is a Linux=20\\r\\nforum but, as long as I\\'m describing the tool, I figured I\\'d ask. It\\'s=20\\r\\nnot the PassMark one. I thought it was called BatMon or something, but=20\\r\\nnow I can\\'t find it anywhere).\\r\\n2 - Does anybody know of a tool that does this in Linux? Or, is there=20\\r\\nsome way to get the Gnome power-history tool to show this kind of stuff?\\r\\n\\r\\n- Joe\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n-- \\r\\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-laptop-REQUEST@lists.debian.org\\r\\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".

Numerous Linux distros are available that \\nlet you boot a stateless but functional system from CD-ROM.\\n\\n> Obviously, you can\\'t do this with partitions that accrue important \\n> state, e.g. a partition that stores database table data.\\n\\n... but if you *do* want some state to persist, then you need a \\nmountable writable partition. To protect it, you need some kind of \\naccess control management to decide who can do what to the writable \\npartition, blah blah blah ... and before you know it, the security \\nproblem starts to look just like it does for conventional servers.\\n\\nSimple approxmation to this: make /usr a separate partion, and mount it \\nread-only:\\n\\n    * The good news: attackers that want to trojan your software have to\\n      reboot, at least.\\n    * The bad news: administrators that want to update your software\\n      have to reboot, at least.\\n\\nCrispin\\n\\n-- \\nCrispin Cowan, Ph.D.\\nChief Scientist, WireX                      http://wirex.com/~crispin/\\nSecurity Hardened Linux Distribution:       http://immunix.org\\nAvailable for purchase: http://wirex.com/Products/Immunix/purchase.html\\n\\n\\n\\n'},\n",

I then\\r\\nfound that, *during a GNOME session*, the brightness OSD did appear. It\\r\\nvanished again after I removed KDE.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, the KDE installation seemed to pull in some package which is\\r\\nresponsible for the brightness OSD. Any idea which of the dozens of\\r\\npackages it might be?\\r\\n\\r\\nLiam\\r\\n\\r\\n-- \\r\\nLiam O\\'Toole\\r\\nBirmingham, United Kingdom\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n-- \\r\\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-user-REQUEST@lists.debian.org \\r\\nwith a subject of \"unsubscribe\".
